                                The game of Bingo began around 1530 in Italy with an Italian lottery called “Lo Giuoco del Lotto D’Italia.”  As the game migrated to North America in 1929 and was called “beano” because the game was played at county fairs using numbered cigar discs and beans. Beano inspired a New York Toy salesman Edwin S. Lowe renamed it Bingo after hearing a player accidentally yell Bingo instead of Beano.  In addition, Lowe hired a Columbia University Math Professor, Carl Leffler to help him increase the number of combinations on bingo cards. Rumor has it that after Professor Leffler invented 6,000 bingo cards, he went insane. <br />
<br />
Bingo’s rise in popularity in Florida came about when Howard Tommie, Chairman of the Seminole Indian Tribe came up with the idea of high stakes bingo in 1971.   On December 14, 1979 James Billie was elected Chairman and in partnership with non-Seminole Eugene “Butch” Weisman opened up Hollywood Bingo at Seminole Casino of Hollywood, Florida.  This was a big step because casino gaming is not permitted in Florida, Bingo is as the Tribe was granted special rights to do so and even when those rights were challenged, the Fifth circuit of Appeals in Atlanta upheld the Tribe’s right to run high stakes bingo. <br />
<br />
The Florida Seminoles continue to feel a sense of victory over Caucasians in their Hollywood Bingo Empire. This pride stems from when their Indian ancestors were driven into the everglades in the early 19th century.  They went from raising cattle, making dolls and baskets to produce revenue and wrestling alligators to entertain tourists to today having 1,200 people play Bingo every afternoon and evening in their $900,000 bingo hall.  Players enjoy valet parking, waitresses and armed escorts to their cars at the end of their play.  An interesting bit of information is that the nightly super jackpot runs as high as $19,000. The revenue generated from this is incredible as charted buses bring players in from as far away as Tampa and players spend an average of $35 a night.  With the majority of earning going to the tribe, they have been able to build gymnasiums, swimming pools and senior citizen and children centers.    About 18 years ago, former Seminole Chairman had said “Indians have historically been able to adapt to their environment.  Generating money is now the name of the game.”  That statement still holds true today.<br />
<br />
Bingo has come a long way and there are thousands of variations of the game either played in a Bingo Hall, the Internet and the Lotto.   In Jacksonville, The Florida Theatre, in order to save them from bankruptcy had come with a special program called “Screeno” which was a bingo game played on the movie screen.  This was the brainchild of the Theatre’s Manager Guy Kenimer.  <br />
<br />
Today they currently employ more than 2,000 non Indians and purchase goods and services from 850 plus Florida vendors a year in the amount of $24 Million plus.  The Seminole Tribe pays Federal payroll taxes in the amount of at least $3.5 Million.  The Seminole Tribe of Florida created the path for Native American gaming in the US. They are headquartered on the Seminole Hollywood Reservation and are a sovereign government.<br />
<br />
The game of Bingo continues to remain popular and grow as electronic equipment, improved facilities and larger jackpots make a huge impact to attracting people.  <br />

Cardroom operations may not be allowed beyond the hours provided in paragraph (b) regardless of the number of cardroom licenses issued for permitholders operating at the pari-mutuel facility.</p>
<p class="p5">(b) Any cardroom operator may operate a cardroom at the pari-mutuel facility daily throughout the year, if the permitholder meets the requirements under paragraph (5)(b). The cardroom may be open a cumulative amount of 18 hours per day on Monday through Friday and 24 hours per day on Saturday and Sunday and on the holidays specified in s. 110.117(1).</p>
<p class="p5">(c) A cardroom operator must at all times employ and provide a nonplaying dealer for each table on which authorized card games which traditionally use a dealer are conducted at the cardroom. Such dealers may not have a participatory interest in any game other than the dealing of cards and may not have an interest in the outcome of the game. The providing of such dealers by a licensee does not constitute the conducting of a banking game by the cardroom operator.</p>
<p class="p5">(d) A cardroom operator may award giveaways, jackpots, and prizes to a player who holds certain combinations of cards specified by the cardroom operator.</p>
<p class="p5">(e) Each cardroom operator shall conspicuously post upon the premises of the cardroom a notice which contains a copy of the cardroom license; a list of authorized games offered by the cardroom; the wagering limits imposed by the house, if any; any additional house rules regarding operation of the cardroom or the playing of any game; and all costs to players to participate, including any rake by the house. In addition, each cardroom operator shall post at each table a notice of the minimum and maximum bets authorized at such table and the fee for participation in the game conducted.</p>
<p class="p5">(f) The cardroom facility is subject to inspection by the division or any law enforcement agency during the licensee&rsquo;s regular business hours. The inspection must specifically include the permitholder internal control procedures approved by the division.</p>
<p class="p5">(g) A cardroom operator may refuse entry to or refuse to allow any person who is objectionable, undesirable, or disruptive to play, but such refusal may not be on the basis of race, creed, color, religion, gender, national origin, marital status, physical handicap, or age, except as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="p5">(8) METHOD OF WAGERS; LIMITATION. &mdash;</p>
<p class="p5">(a) No wagering may be conducted using money or other negotiable currency. Games may only be played utilizing a wagering system whereby all players&rsquo; money is first converted by the house to tokens or chips which shall be used for wagering only at that specific cardroom.</p>
<p class="p5">(b) The cardroom operator may limit the amount wagered in any game or series of games.</p>

Tournaments may be played only with tournament chips that are provided to all participants in exchange for an entry fee and any subsequent re-buys. All players must receive an equal number of tournament chips for their entry fee. Tournament chips have no cash value and represent tournament points only. There is no limitation on the number of tournament chips that may be used for a bet except as otherwise determined by the cardroom operator. Tournament chips may never be redeemed for cash or for any other thing of value. The distribution of prizes and cash awards must be determined by the cardroom operator before entry fees are accepted. For purposes of tournament play only, the term &ldquo;gross receipts&rdquo; means the total amount received by the cardroom operator for all entry fees, player re-buys, and fees for participating in the tournament less the total amount paid to the winners or others as prizes.</p>
<p class="p5">(9) BOND REQUIRED. &mdash; The holder of a cardroom license shall be financially and otherwise responsible for the operation of the cardroom and for the conduct of any manager, dealer, or other employee involved in the operation of the cardroom. Prior to the issuance of a cardroom license, each applicant for such license shall provide evidence of a surety bond in the amount of $50,000, payable to the state, furnished by a corporate surety authorized to do business in the state or evidence that the licensee&rsquo;s pari-mutuel bond required by s. 550.125 has been expanded to include the applicant&rsquo;s cardroom operation. The bond shall guarantee that the cardroom operator will redeem, for cash, all tokens or chips used in games. Such bond shall be kept in full force and effect by the operator during the term of the license.</p>
<p class="p5">(10) FEE FOR PARTICIPATION. &mdash; The cardroom operator may charge a fee for the right to participate in games conducted at the cardroom. Such fee may be either a flat fee or hourly rate for the use of a seat at a table or a rake subject to the posted maximum amount but may not be based on the amount won by players. The rake-off, if any, must be made in an obvious manner and placed in a designated rake area which is clearly visible to all players. Notice of the amount of the participation fee charged shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the cardroom and at each table at all times.</p>
<p class="p5">(11) RECORDS AND REPORTS. &mdash;</p>

<p class="p5">(12) PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES. &mdash;</p>

<p class="p5">(b) An admission tax equal to 15 percent of the admission charge for entrance to the licensee&rsquo;s cardroom facility, or 10 cents, whichever is greater, is imposed on each person entering the cardroom. This admission tax shall apply only if a separate admission fee is charged for entry to the cardroom facility. If a single admission fee is charged which authorizes entry to both or either the pari-mutuel facility and the cardroom facility, the admission tax shall be payable only once and shall be payable pursuant to chapter 550. The cardroom licensee shall be responsible for collecting the admission tax. An admission tax is imposed on any free passes or complimentary cards issued to guests by licensees in an amount equal to the tax imposed on the regular and usual admission charge for entrance to the licensee&rsquo;s cardroom facility. A cardroom licensee may issue tax-free passes to its officers, officials, and employees or other persons actually engaged in working at the cardroom, including accredited press representatives such as reporters and editors, and may also issue tax-free passes to other cardroom licensees for the use of their officers and officials. The licensee shall file with the division a list of all persons to whom tax-free passes are issued.</p>
<p class="p5">(c) Payment of the admission tax and gross receipts tax imposed by this section shall be paid to the division. The division shall deposit these sums with the Chief Financial Officer, one-half being credited to the Pari-mutuel Wagering Trust Fund and one-half being credited to the General Revenue Fund. The cardroom licensee shall remit to the division payment for the admission tax, the gross receipts tax, and the licensee fees. Such payments shall be remitted to the division on the fifth day of each calendar month for taxes and fees imposed for the preceding month&rsquo;s cardroom activities. Licensees shall file a report under oath by the fifth day of each calendar month for all taxes remitted during the preceding calendar month. Such report shall, under oath, indicate the total of all admissions, the cardroom activities for the preceding calendar month, and such other information as may be prescribed by the division.</p>

<p class="p5">3. No cardroom license or renewal thereof shall be issued to an applicant holding a permit under chapter 550 to conduct pari-mutuel wagering meets of quarter horse racing unless the applicant has on file with the division a binding written agreement between the applicant and the Florida Quarter Horse Racing Association or the association representing a majority of the horse owners and trainers at the applicant&rsquo;s eligible facility, governing the payment of purses on live quarter horse races conducted at the licensee&rsquo;s pari-mutuel facility. The agreement governing purses may direct the payment of such purses from revenues generated by any wagering or gaming the applicant is authorized to conduct under Florida law. All purses shall be subject to the terms of chapter 550.</p>
<p class="p5">(e) The failure of any licensee to make payments as prescribed in paragraph (c) is a violation of this section, and the licensee may be subjected by the division to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each day the tax payment is not remitted. All penalties imposed and collected shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund.

<p class="p5">(f) The cardroom shall be deemed an accessory use to a licensed pari-mutuel operation and, except as provided in chapter 550, a municipality, county, or political subdivision may not assess or collect any additional license tax, sales tax, or excise tax on such cardroom operation.</p>
<p class="p5">(g) All of the moneys deposited in the Pari-mutuel Wagering Trust Fund, except as set forth in paragraph (h), shall be utilized and distributed in the manner specified in s. 550.135(1) and (2).

<p class="p5">(h) One-quarter of the moneys deposited into the Pari-mutuel Wagering Trust Fund pursuant to paragraph (g) shall, by October 1 of each year, be distributed to the local government that approved the cardroom under subsection (16); however, if two or more pari-mutuel racetracks are located within the same incorporated municipality, the cardroom funds shall be distributed to the municipality. If a pari-mutuel facility is situated in such a manner that it is located in more than one county, the site of the cardroom facility shall determine the location for purposes of disbursement of tax revenues under this paragraph. The division shall, by September 1 of each year, determine: the amount of taxes deposited into the Pari-mutuel Wagering Trust Fund pursuant to this section from each cardroom licensee; the location by county of each cardroom; whether the cardroom is located in the unincorporated area of the county or within an incorporated municipality; and, the total amount to be distributed to each eligible county and municipality.</p>

<p class="tight-top">(a) Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, no cardroom gaming license issued under this section shall be transferred, or reissued when such reissuance is in the nature of a transfer, so as to permit or authorize a licensee to change the location of the cardroom except upon proof in such form as the division may prescribe that a referendum election has been held:</p>

Where the owner of the property has been convicted of a violation of the statutes and laws of this state prohibiting lotteries or gambling such conviction shall be prima facie evidence that each claimant had reason to believe that the property might be used for or in connection with a violation of such statutes and laws, and it shall be incumbent upon such claimant to satisfy the court that he or she was without knowledge of such conviction. Trial of all such causes shall be without a jury, except in such cases as a trial by jury may be guaranteed by the State Constitution and in such cases trial by jury shall be deemed waived unless demanded in the claim filed.</p>

<p class="p5">73-299.</p>
<p class="p5"><b><a name="849.43"></a>849.43<span>&nbsp;</span>Judgment of forfeiture</b>. &mdash; On final hearing the return of the sheriff to the clerk of the circuit court shall be taken as prima facie evidence that the property seized was or had been used in, or in connection with, the violation of the statutes and laws of this state prohibiting lotteries and gambling in this state and shall be sufficient predicate for a judgment of forfeiture in the absence of other proofs and evidence. The burden shall be upon the claimants to show that the property was not so used or if so used that they had no knowledge of such violation and no reason to believe that the seized property was or would be used for the violation of such statutes and laws. Where such property is encumbered by a lien or retained title agreement under circumstances wherein the lienholder had no knowledge that the property was or would be used in violating such statutes and laws, and no reasonable reason to believe that it might be so used, then the court may declare a forfeiture of all other rights, titles and interests, subject, however, to the lien of such innocent lienholder, or may direct the payment of such lien from the proceeds of any sale of the said property. The proceedings and the judgment of forfeiture shall be in rem and shall be primarily against the property itself. Upon the entry of a judgment of forfeiture the court shall determine the disposition to be made of the property, which may include the destruction thereof, the sale thereof, the allocation thereof to some governmental function or use, or otherwise as the court may determine. Sales of such property shall be at public sale to the highest and best bidder therefor for cash after 2 weeks&rsquo; public notice as the court may direct. Where the property has been delivered to a claimant upon the posting of a bond the court shall determine the value of the property or portion thereof subject to forfeiture and shall enter judgment against the principal and surety of the bond in such amount for which execution shall issue in the usual manner. Upon the application of any claimant the court may fix the value of the forfeitable interest or interests in the seized property and permit such claimant to redeem the said property upon the payment of a sum equal to said value, which sum shall be disposed of as would the proceeds of a sale of the said property under a judgment of forfeiture.</p>
<p class="p5"><b><a name="849.44"></a>849.44<span>&nbsp;</span>Disposition of proceeds of forfeiture</b>. &mdash; All sums received from a sale or other disposition of the seized property shall be paid into the county fine and forfeiture fund and shall become a part thereof; provided, however, that in instances where the seizure is by a municipal police officer within the limits of any municipality having an ordinance requiring such vehicles, vessels or conveyances to be forfeited, the city attorney shall act in behalf of the city in lieu of the state attorney and shall proceed to forfeit the property as herein provided, and all sums received therefrom shall go into the general operating fund of the city.</p>
<p class="p5"><b><a name="849.45"></a>849.45<span>&nbsp;</span>Fees for services</b>. &mdash; Fees for services required hereunder shall be the same as provided for sheriffs and clerks for like and similar services in other cases and matters.</p>
<p class="p5"><b><a name="849.46"></a>849.46<span>&nbsp;</span>Exercise of police power</b>. &mdash; It is deemed by the Legislature that this chapter is necessary for the more efficient and proper enforcement of the statutes and laws of this state prohibiting lotteries and gambling, and a lawful exercise of the police power of the state for the protection of the public welfare, health, safety and morals of the people of the state. All the provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of these purposes.</p>                            </div>

                                In 1932 the state of Florida legalized pari-mutuel betting in more counties to bring more revenue to the State during the Great Depression. This step forward for legalized gambling paved the way to more tourism which then helped the local economy recover.<br />
<br />
This was followed by the legalization of Jai-Alai in 1935. Jai-Alai was first introduced in 1926 at the Miami Fronton although it was a legal sport; it was not a legal betting event. <br />
<br />
Later during 1935 slot machines were legalized in Florida, later in 1973 though this law was repealed, and the slot machines had to be removed.  1979 brought legalized Indian bingo halls thus allowing the Indian tribes to support themselves with the gambling profits.<br />
<br />
In 1984 "cruises to nowhere" was introduced to circumvent the law by taking patrons out to the high seas to gamble on a casino ship. The only purpose in the ship was to gamble, hence the name, cruise to nowhere.<br />
<br />
1986 the Florida Lottery was unveiled; the vote was passed by a two to one margin. Voters gave approval since all of the proceeds are supposed to go to education in Florida.<br />
<br />
Casinos were shot down by Florida voters in 1978, 1986, and 1994 but finally in 2004, Florida voters voted in favor of legalized casino gambling. <br />
<br />
Today there are 137 casinos in Florida and Florida ranks 4 out of 46 in number of casinos in all the states in US that have gaming facilities if you count the cruise ships with casinos that leave from here.<br />
<br />
Hialeah Park Race Track opened in 1925 and received more press coverage in the Miami media than any other sporting event in the history of Miami.<br />
<br />
Tourism was encouraged during the lean years around the Great Depression, starting around 1928 by gambling, legal or illegal. In fact, Al Capone moved to Miami in 1928 and gambling took on a bit more sinister character.<br />
<br />
In 1928 Cap's Place, originally called Club Unique, was established as a supper club and gambling casino. Gambling was illegal in Florida at the time but this did not stop Cap's Place. Slot machines lined the hallway between the dining room and the kitchen and a wheel of fortune hung over the bar. Cap's had it all, including dice and blackjack games. In the 1930's the gambling interests, who controlled the action, advised Cap to spruce up the place so he added red carpeting and private gambling rooms.<br />
<br />
In January of 1942 the most famous visitors arrived, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D Roosevelt. They held a series of secret war conferences right in Cap's Place. It is not known if they did any gambling while there.<br />
<br />
In 1979 the Seminole Tribe opened a high stakes bingo parlor that did not conform to state law and spurred the first major litigation. The Indian Tribes won on appeal in the US Court of Appeals.<br />
<br />
On December 5,1933, Sloppy Joe's opened In Key West, Florida. Joe Russell was the proprietor. It was originally called the "Blind Pig" and renamed the "Silver Slipper" when a dance floor was added but the real attraction was the food and the gambling. One of the most famous patrons was Ernest Hemmingway, who encouraged the name change to "Sloppy Joe's" and the name stuck as did the gambling. <br />
<br />
In 1876 the city of Keno was denied the request for a post office because of its name which means gambling (which was one of the favorite pastimes of the town). The city had to change its name to Leno to prove it was a decent town. <br />

                                Betting on horse racing has been around for hundreds of years dating back to colonial times, horse owners would put up a stake on their horse at the beginning of a race.  The amount from all horse owners would make up the winner’s purse (prize money).  Betting turned horseracing into a large entity in which racing associations, owners, jockeys and state governments profited from the volume of wagering.   Bookmakers saw that horse racing was a profitable business and basically took over the scene after the Civil War.  The faster the sport grew along with the nation, it became against the law in several states because it was considered gambling.<br />
  <br />
Pari-Mutuel betting, a French term which means “mutual stake” came about after an unsuccessful stint during the nineteenth century. It was revitalized in the 1920’s when an automatic odds calculator called a totalizator came into use. It was a machine that took money, printed betting tickets and calculated odds based on betting volume continuously.   All wagers for a race are placed together in a betting pool that is divided up between the winners, the pari-mutel facility share which is termed takeout; a percentage set by state law.  The more people placing wagers in the pool the bigger the payout will be. Spectators bet against each other and not against the house.  Prior to this system, the Bookmakers would pay a flat fee to the racing facility that included being able to operate there and fee money. <br />
<br />
The first year round horseracing in Florida began in the 1930’s with the inception of winter racing.  In 1931, The Florida State Racing Commission was established to regulate the industry.  In 1971, this Commission was dismembered and taken over by the Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering in the Department of Business Regulation until 1978.  The Florida Pari-Mutuel Commission was then established in 1978 under the Department of Business Regulation.  This Commission approves racing days and dates and hears appeals related to the suspension or revocation of pari-mutuel licenses at pari-mutuel facilities.  Pari-mutuel gambling also is used for greyhound racing and Jai Alai matches (a game similar to handball).<br />
<br />
 Greyhounds were bred to hunt by outrunning their prey and they can run 45mph within 30 feet.  These dogs enjoy working with other dogs as well as being around other dogs.  This part of a greyhound’s personality makes them perfect for racing.  It is the sixth largest spectator sport in the world. In 1922, Florida became the “US Capital” of the sport of greyhound racing.<br />
<br />
They begin a race by bounding out of an electronic starting gate and running after a mechanical rabbit.  The greyhound who reaches the finish line is the winner.  <br />
<br />
There are fourteen greyhound tracks, three thoroughbred tracks and one harness racing track in Florida.  The now extinct Hialeah Park, South Florida opened its doors in 1932.  The park was glamorous and magnets for people like Al Capone, The Vanderbilt’s and The Kennedy’s.   Winston Churchill once was asked to describe the track and he said it was “Extraordinary!”<br />
