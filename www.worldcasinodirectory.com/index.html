            <div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_540" style="display:none"><p>Seafaring gamblers in the Nordic region, especially the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, have been enjoying the gambling services of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paf</a> on Tallink and Silja line cruises for over three decades. The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>
<p>Costa Cruises brand currently operates six casino ships and 8 vessels without gaming facilities. All sail under the Italian flag in the waters of the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, and South America. None of the casino spaces are huge by international standards but all are well appointed and offer tables and slots. The <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-mediterranea-2160.html">Mediterranea</a>, sailing out of Savona in Italy, offers the most slots with over 140 machines, while the <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-atlantica-2156.html">Atlantica</a>, departing from Tianjin, China offers the most table games with a count of 21.</p>
<p>The table game selection varies by ship but you will usually find blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as craps on some vessels.</p>
<p>All of the vessels offer fine dining, recreation, entertainment, shopping, sport, and wellness facilities including spas. Some of the ships without casino feature 4D Cinema as part of the kids' package of family fun.</p>
<p>Some of the amenities found on Costa Cruises Fortuna, sailing out of Port Rashid, Dubai, United Arab Emirates include a theater, library, art gallery, cognac bar and a cigar bar. Dining ranges from casual to fine dining on all vessels with 7-Michelin starred chef's tending to your needs on some.</p>
<p>For those who smoke and those who prefer not to be exposed, all cabins and public rooms are smoke-free. There are designated spaces on open decks for smokers and you can smoke on your private cabin balcony - and of course, in the Cigar Bar. e-cigarettes are in your cabin as well.</p>
<p>neoClassica and neoRomantica sail out of Mumbai, India and Port Louis, Mauritius respectively and offer a good variety of gaming.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_882" style="display:none"><p>Crystal Cruises is an American luxury liner with two casino outfitted ships as of 2018. Formerly owned and operated by Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) with Caesars Casinos onboard, the line was sold to <a href="owners/genting-hong-kong.html">Genting Hong Kong</a> in 2015. The casinos were rebranded as Resorts World casinos after Genting's other land-based casino brand.</p>

Starting out with Britain's first transatlantic steamship mail contract, there are now three vessels in operation offering Northern European, Mediterranean, Transatlantic, Caribbean, and World Cruises.</p>
<p>The fleet currently consists of the ocean liner <a href="casino/queen-mary-2-2206.html">Queen Mary 2</a>, and cruise ships <a href="casino/cunard-line-queen-elizabeth-2-2165.html">Queen Elizabeth</a> and <a href="casino/cunard-cruises-queen-victoria.html">Queen Victoria</a>. A 4th vessel is slated for operation n 2022. There is a casino on board each Cunard ship. However, not all cruises offer gambling as the Empire Casinos do not open during voyages without foreign ports of call on the itinerary.

Through a series of mergers, decouplings, acquisitions and investments the NYSE-listed company based in Florida is now owned in the minority by private equity companies as well as <a href="owners/genting-group.html">Genting Group</a> which holds an 11.1% stake. The NCL holding company also owns <a href="owners/oceania-cruises.html">Oceania Cruises</a> and <a href="owners/regent-seven-seas-cruises.html">Regent Seven Seas Cruises</a> through a 2014 acquisition of parent company, Prestige Cruises International, Inc.</p>
<p>Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCL) offers informal casino cruises with no structured time for meals and some other activities and no need to dress formally at mealtime. For family travelers, Norwegian Escape, Breakaway, Getaway, and <a href="casino/norwegian-cruise-lines-epic.html">Epic</a> offer the most 'kid friendly' cruises. All 15 of the ships, including Pride of America, the only US-flagged vessel in the fleet, offer gambling once the ships leave territorial waters.</p>
<p>Game variety varies from ship to ship but a sampling of available games includes slots, blackjack and 21 variants, craps, roulette, three card poker, let it ride, Ultimate Texas Hold'em, baccarat, Pai Gow poker, and Texas Hold'em poker. Some of the blackjack variants include a Lucky Ladies side bet with a $5,000 jackpot. Lucky Ladies is available on all ships. All ships except Epic, Breakaway, and Getaway offer a Wheel of Madness side bet on the game. The optional bet can range from $1 to $10. When a player with a stake on the wheel is dealt a natural Blackjack they'll get a spin on the wheel to determine their side bet multiplier. The top prize is $5,000.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy sailing on small city-size ships, Norwegian has added a third vessel to its Breakaway-Plus series with the launch of the 168,028-ton, 1,082-foot-long,  20-deck, 4,004 passenger <a href="casino/norwegian-cruise-lines-norwegian-bliss.html">Norwegian Bliss</a> in 2018. She joins Escape and Joy in the class. Those ships launched in 2015 and 2017, respectively.</p>
<p>The cruise line is very popular and consistently adds to its fleet. There are 7 new additions to the fleet slated for release between 2019 and 2027. The five most recent debuts include Norwegian Bliss (2018), Joy (2017) Escape (2015), Getaway (2014), and Breakaway (2013).</p>
<p>So far, Norwegian Bliss is the most innovative casino ship in the fleet with over 300 pokies (slots and video poker) and 25 gaming tables.</p>
<p>Across the fleet, poker players register well ahead of time for the Norwegian Cruise Line Poker Challenge (NCLPC). The field is expected to surpass 400 participants soon.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_878" style="display:none"><p>Oceania Cruises launched their first ship in 2002 and currently has a fleet of six ships. All of them offer gambling facilities. Founded by a team of cruise industry veterans, the company was acquired by <a href="owners/norwegian-cruise-line.html">Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, LTD</a> in 2014 along with a sister company, <a href="owners/regent-seven-seas-cruises.html">Regent Seven Seas Cruises</a>. Norwegian (NCL) is headquartered in Florida. All of Oceania's vessels fly the flag of the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>There are 4 ships in the Regatta class, all were built in 1998, 1999, or 2000. The <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-regatta-2197.html">MS Regatta</a> was launched in 2003 and last refurbished in 2014. The most recent launch in the class was the 30,277 ton, 343 cabin, <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-serina.html">MS Sirena</a>. The former Ocean Princess underwent a $40 million refurbishment in France and launched in 2016.</p>
<p>Two brand new Oceania class ships were commissioned from Italian builder Fincantieri and are the first two new builds for the company. <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-marina.html">MS Marina</a>, at 66,084 tons can hold 1,250 passengers and 580 of the 625 suites and cabins have private verandas. Marina launched in 2011. Her sister ship, which launched in 2012, is the <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-riviera.html">MS Riviera</a>.</p>
<p>Two-week-long cruises are the norm for Oceania but they are most well known for much longer tours such as "Around the World in 180 Days" voyages and others lasting up to 195 days. The 6-month world cruises began in 2015. Bookings for the 180-Day World Cruises are taken up to two years in advance.</p>
<p>The casinos are rather small in relation to the overall ship size on some vessels, mainly due to the extended times at sea. However, they are also a favorite attraction of many oceanfarers. The gambling spaces are well designed and stylish and offer table limits for all levels of players. The gaming machines include reel and video slots and video poker machines.</p>
<p>Key card wagering makes the slots cashless. Casino credit is available to qualified guests and should be arranged one-month prior to departure. The minimum credit line is $10,000 and a personal check is required when you board the vessel in order to activate a credit line. All gaming is in USD and Euros can be exchanged on board.</p>
<p>All play is tracked and rewarded through the Casinos at Sea rewards program which has 5 tiers. Points can be transfered from ship to ship and slot players can redeem rewards at any time onscreen while playing any game.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_872" style="display:none"><p>P&amp;O Cruises is the oldest cruise line in the world. The original company was founded in 1837 and the first passenger cruises from Southampton were offered in 1844. A series of de-mergers and mergers beginning in 2000 culminated in a merger with Carnival Corporation in 2003. The company operates seven cruise ships including Britannia which launched in early 2015. Two more large vessels are planned for launch in 2020 and 2020. All ships offer casino gaming once entering international waters.</p>
<p>Table games, slot machines, bingo, scratch cards, and video horse racing are all offered.</p>
<p>Roulette, blackjack, and three card poker are offered on all ships. Three of the casinos also offer Fun 21. If you don't see the game when aboard the <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-arcadia.html">Arcadia</a> and there is an empty blackjack table, ask your host to flip the table as the Fun 21 felt is just underneath. Purchase your chips from the dealer with cash or your cruise card. All winnings are cashed out onto your cruise card.</p>
<p>Slot machines all operate on a coinless system. To play, simply insert your cruise card or cash notes.</p>
<p>Bingo offers five cash prizes each full day out to sea. There's also a jackpot that grows with nearly every game and must be won by the conclusion of the cruise.</p>
<p>Scratch cards have prizes up to &pound;20,000 and can be purchased at the casino desk. Video horse racing is presented on big screens.</p>
<p>Arcadia features 4 tables and a variety of slots on the F deck. <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-aurora-1709.html">Aurora's casino</a> is located on the Prom deck and features 4 tables and slots. Head to the F deck on Azura to find five tables offering three card poker, blackjack, roulette x2, and Fun 21.</p>
<p>The casino on Britannia is deck 6 with 2 tables each offering blackjack, roulette, and three card poker. <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-oceana-1710.html">Oceana</a> has five tables on D deck - Oriana offers 23 tables on the Prom deck, and there are five tables on F deck of Ventura.</p>
<p>On sea days slots are open on all ships from 10 am until late with tables opening at noon. On port days, gaming doesn't start until the ship reaches international waters, which usually takes about 45 minutes. Opening times can vary by jurisdiction, but the demarcation point is usually 12 miles outside of port limits.</p>
<p>Be sure to cash in your chips before leaving the ship. If you happen to forget, you can bring them along for your next voyage but may meet delays while the chips are authenticated.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_877" style="display:none"><p>Princess Cruises launched their first Mexican Riviera cruise in 1965 but didn't become a household name known to people who vacation at sea until about a decade later when the company was acquired by P&amp;O, who at the time was the world's largest oceanic shipper with more 300 vessels in operation. Baby boomers may recall <a href="casino/princess-cruises-island-princess-2024.html">Island Princess</a> and <a href="casino/princess-cruises-pacific-princess-2025.html">Pacific Princess</a> as the ships featured in the 1970s television series, The Love Boat.</p>
<p>P&amp;O spun off its passenger division in 2000, and it merged with <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Carnival</a> in 2003. The combined company then featured 11 different brands of cruise ship companies. Princess, Carnival, and Holland America stopped requisitioning new ships during the 2008 economic downturn but added three new 3,600 passenger ships beginning with Royal Princess in 2013 and Regal Princess which entered service in 2014. A third Fincantieri-built ship, Majestic Princess launched in 2017.</p>
<p>The entire current fleet flies the flag of Bermuda except for Royal, Majestic, Golden, Diamond, and Sapphire Princess which ships call the UK home. Three additional Bermuda-flagged Royal Class vessels are slated for launch in 2019, 2020, and 2022.</p>
<p>Departure points for Princess Cruises include <a href="british-columbia/vancouver.html">Vancouver, Canada</a>, Brisbane, Rozelle, and Melbourne in Australia; Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in the US, as well as <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Rome, Italy, and Piraeus in Greece.</p>
<p>USA Today has awarded Princess the accolade of "Best cruise lines for Gamblers" and slots fans are frequently offered high return tournaments like the $200,000 Monopoly Cruise for Cash tournament. There are tournaments on every cruise so blackjack players and slots spinners have a chance to compete against their shipmates for cash prizes.</p>
<p>Games vary from ship to ship but most voyagers will find traditional, video, and progressive jackpot slot machines as well as video poker. Table games can include heads-up Texas Hold ‘Em poker, and casino games like Caribbean Stud Poker, Three Card Poker and Let it Ride. Blackjack, dice, roulette, and other table games are available on most ships and you can even play bingo with ticket packages ranging from $10 to $30.</p>
<p>A fairly new "class" of ships was introduced in 2017, known as the Ocean Medallion Class. These are 'the internet of things' ships with omnichannel connectivity to guests accounts from a medallion wristband. On ships appointed with the amenity, guests have access to the PlayOcean Casino and PlayOcean Everywhere so they can play real money games anywhere on the ship.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_874" style="display:none"><p>Pullmantur Cruises is the largest cruise line based in <a href="spain.html">Spain</a>.

<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>

<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>

<h2>#1 Florida Casino Cruise?</h2>
<p>Judging by the reviews on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34117-d2229441-Reviews-Victory_Casino_Cruises-Cape_Canaveral_Brevard_County_Florida.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor</a>, most people are extremely satisfied with their Victory Casino Cruise experiences.

<p><strong>You might say:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Okay, I get it. But what about the casino... is it a real casino?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>
<p>It's a real casino alright. There are over 600 slots so there should always be some open. On a busy cruise, they'll open up to 100 gaming tables. That puts it on par with most Downtown Las Vegas properties and quite a few on the Strip.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you can play...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slots</li>
<li>Blackjack $5-$500 - dealer stands all 17's - BJ pays 3:2</li>
<li>Craps</li>
<li>Roulette</li>
<li>EZ Baccarat</li>
<li>Ultimate Texas Hold'em</li>

<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>Visit Windstar Cruises to find a cruise, plan your journey, look for specials, or<a href="https://www.windstarcruises.com/yachts/" target="_blank"> dream about the yachts</a>!</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_540" style="display:none"><p>Seafaring gamblers in the Nordic region, especially the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, have been enjoying the gambling services of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paf</a> on Tallink and Silja line cruises for over three decades. The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>
<p>Costa Cruises brand currently operates six casino ships and 8 vessels without gaming facilities. All sail under the Italian flag in the waters of the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, and South America. None of the casino spaces are huge by international standards but all are well appointed and offer tables and slots. The <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-mediterranea-2160.html">Mediterranea</a>, sailing out of Savona in Italy, offers the most slots with over 140 machines, while the <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-atlantica-2156.html">Atlantica</a>, departing from Tianjin, China offers the most table games with a count of 21.</p>
<p>The table game selection varies by ship but you will usually find blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as craps on some vessels.</p>
<p>All of the vessels offer fine dining, recreation, entertainment, shopping, sport, and wellness facilities including spas. Some of the ships without casino feature 4D Cinema as part of the kids' package of family fun.</p>
<p>Some of the amenities found on Costa Cruises Fortuna, sailing out of Port Rashid, Dubai, United Arab Emirates include a theater, library, art gallery, cognac bar and a cigar bar.

Starting out with Britain's first transatlantic steamship mail contract, there are now three vessels in operation offering Northern European, Mediterranean, Transatlantic, Caribbean, and World Cruises.</p>
<p>The fleet currently consists of the ocean liner <a href="casino/queen-mary-2-2206.html">Queen Mary 2</a>, and cruise ships <a href="casino/cunard-line-queen-elizabeth-2-2165.html">Queen Elizabeth</a> and <a href="casino/cunard-cruises-queen-victoria.html">Queen Victoria</a>. A 4th vessel is slated for operation n 2022. There is a casino on board each Cunard ship. However, not all cruises offer gambling as the Empire Casinos do not open during voyages without foreign ports of call on the itinerary.

All of them offer gambling facilities. Founded by a team of cruise industry veterans, the company was acquired by <a href="owners/norwegian-cruise-line.html">Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, LTD</a> in 2014 along with a sister company, <a href="owners/regent-seven-seas-cruises.html">Regent Seven Seas Cruises</a>. Norwegian (NCL) is headquartered in Florida. All of Oceania's vessels fly the flag of the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>There are 4 ships in the Regatta class, all were built in 1998, 1999, or 2000. The <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-regatta-2197.html">MS Regatta</a> was launched in 2003 and last refurbished in 2014. The most recent launch in the class was the 30,277 ton, 343 cabin, <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-serina.html">MS Sirena</a>. The former Ocean Princess underwent a $40 million refurbishment in France and launched in 2016.</p>
<p>Two brand new Oceania class ships were commissioned from Italian builder Fincantieri and are the first two new builds for the company. <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-marina.html">MS Marina</a>, at 66,084 tons can hold 1,250 passengers and 580 of the 625 suites and cabins have private verandas. Marina launched in 2011. Her sister ship, which launched in 2012, is the <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-riviera.html">MS Riviera</a>.</p>
<p>Two-week-long cruises are the norm for Oceania but they are most well known for much longer tours such as "Around the World in 180 Days" voyages and others lasting up to 195 days. The 6-month world cruises began in 2015. Bookings for the 180-Day World Cruises are taken up to two years in advance.</p>
<p>The casinos are rather small in relation to the overall ship size on some vessels, mainly due to the extended times at sea. However, they are also a favorite attraction of many oceanfarers. The gambling spaces are well designed and stylish and offer table limits for all levels of players. The gaming machines include reel and video slots and video poker machines.</p>
<p>Key card wagering makes the slots cashless. Casino credit is available to qualified guests and should be arranged one-month prior to departure. The minimum credit line is $10,000 and a personal check is required when you board the vessel in order to activate a credit line. All gaming is in USD and Euros can be exchanged on board.</p>
<p>All play is tracked and rewarded through the Casinos at Sea rewards program which has 5 tiers. Points can be transfered from ship to ship and slot players can redeem rewards at any time onscreen while playing any game.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_872" style="display:none"><p>P&amp;O Cruises is the oldest cruise line in the world. The original company was founded in 1837 and the first passenger cruises from Southampton were offered in 1844. A series of de-mergers and mergers beginning in 2000 culminated in a merger with Carnival Corporation in 2003. The company operates seven cruise ships including Britannia which launched in early 2015. Two more large vessels are planned for launch in 2020 and 2020. All ships offer casino gaming once entering international waters.</p>
<p>Table games, slot machines, bingo, scratch cards, and video horse racing are all offered.</p>
<p>Roulette, blackjack, and three card poker are offered on all ships. Three of the casinos also offer Fun 21. If you don't see the game when aboard the <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-arcadia.html">Arcadia</a> and there is an empty blackjack table, ask your host to flip the table as the Fun 21 felt is just underneath. Purchase your chips from the dealer with cash or your cruise card. All winnings are cashed out onto your cruise card.</p>
<p>Slot machines all operate on a coinless system. To play, simply insert your cruise card or cash notes.</p>
<p>Bingo offers five cash prizes each full day out to sea. There's also a jackpot that grows with nearly every game and must be won by the conclusion of the cruise.</p>
<p>Scratch cards have prizes up to &pound;20,000 and can be purchased at the casino desk. Video horse racing is presented on big screens.</p>
<p>Arcadia features 4 tables and a variety of slots on the F deck. <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-aurora-1709.html">Aurora's casino</a> is located on the Prom deck and features 4 tables and slots.

<p>On sea days slots are open on all ships from 10 am until late with tables opening at noon. On port days, gaming doesn't start until the ship reaches international waters, which usually takes about 45 minutes. Opening times can vary by jurisdiction, but the demarcation point is usually 12 miles outside of port limits.</p>
<p>Be sure to cash in your chips before leaving the ship. If you happen to forget, you can bring them along for your next voyage but may meet delays while the chips are authenticated.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_877" style="display:none"><p>Princess Cruises launched their first Mexican Riviera cruise in 1965 but didn't become a household name known to people who vacation at sea until about a decade later when the company was acquired by P&amp;O, who at the time was the world's largest oceanic shipper with more 300 vessels in operation. Baby boomers may recall <a href="casino/princess-cruises-island-princess-2024.html">Island Princess</a> and <a href="casino/princess-cruises-pacific-princess-2025.html">Pacific Princess</a> as the ships featured in the 1970s television series, The Love Boat.</p>
<p>P&amp;O spun off its passenger division in 2000, and it merged with <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Carnival</a> in 2003. The combined company then featured 11 different brands of cruise ship companies. Princess, Carnival, and Holland America stopped requisitioning new ships during the 2008 economic downturn but added three new 3,600 passenger ships beginning with Royal Princess in 2013 and Regal Princess which entered service in 2014. A third Fincantieri-built ship, Majestic Princess launched in 2017.</p>
<p>The entire current fleet flies the flag of Bermuda except for Royal, Majestic, Golden, Diamond, and Sapphire Princess which ships call the UK home. Three additional Bermuda-flagged Royal Class vessels are slated for launch in 2019, 2020, and 2022.</p>
<p>Departure points for Princess Cruises include <a href="british-columbia/vancouver.html">Vancouver, Canada</a>, Brisbane, Rozelle, and Melbourne in Australia; Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in the US, as well as <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Rome, Italy, and Piraeus in Greece.</p>
<p>USA Today has awarded Princess the accolade of "Best cruise lines for Gamblers" and slots fans are frequently offered high return tournaments like the $200,000 Monopoly Cruise for Cash tournament. There are tournaments on every cruise so blackjack players and slots spinners have a chance to compete against their shipmates for cash prizes.</p>
<p>Games vary from ship to ship but most voyagers will find traditional, video, and progressive jackpot slot machines as well as video poker. Table games can include heads-up Texas Hold ‘Em poker, and casino games like Caribbean Stud Poker, Three Card Poker and Let it Ride. Blackjack, dice, roulette, and other table games are available on most ships and you can even play bingo with ticket packages ranging from $10 to $30.</p>
<p>A fairly new "class" of ships was introduced in 2017, known as the Ocean Medallion Class.

<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>

<p>There are no gaming facilities on the smaller expedition class ships.</p>
<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>
<p>You can click the following link to view the <a href="https://www.silversea.com/ships/silver-shadow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">casino aboard Silver Shadow</a>.</p>
<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package. If unsure of local laws, please wait until you are 12 miles out to sea before you <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/">gambling online</a>.</p>

If you are looking for a 'cruise to nowhere' this might be your best bet. The Victory I first set sail in 1972 and was refurbished before Victory launched their casino cruise.</p>
<p>If you've ever been on a gambling ship, as opposed to a luxury cruise liner with a casino...</p>
<p><strong>You might ask:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I thought gambling was a monopoly in Florida. How do they do it?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, most of the <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots">slots</a> and table games are in the <a href="florida.html">Seminole Tribe's Hard Rock casinos</a>. You can find poker and a few <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">other games like poker</a> at <a href="florida.html">Florida racetracks</a> and jai alai frontons.</p>
<p>Once the ship enters international waters, Florida gambling laws no longer apply.</p>
<p>The 3-mile journey usually takes about 30 minutes - then the games are on!</p>
<h2>#1 Florida Casino Cruise?</h2>
<p>Judging by the reviews on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34117-d2229441-Reviews-Victory_Casino_Cruises-Cape_Canaveral_Brevard_County_Florida.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor</a>, most people are extremely satisfied with their Victory Casino Cruise experiences. Those who weren't might not have known what to expect.</p>
<p>This is a gambling ship <br />You'll be out to sea for 5-6 hours <br />People smoke outside, so you might smell it</p>
<p><strong>You might say:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Okay, I get it. But what about the casino... is it a real casino?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>
<p>It's a real casino alright. There are over 600 slots so there should always be some open. On a busy cruise, they'll open up to 100 gaming tables. That puts it on par with most Downtown Las Vegas properties and quite a few on the Strip.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you can play...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slots</li>
<li>Blackjack $5-$500 - dealer stands all 17's - BJ pays 3:2</li>
<li>Craps</li>
<li>Roulette</li>
<li>EZ Baccarat</li>
<li>Ultimate Texas Hold'em</li>
<li>Mississippi Stud</li>

<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>Visit Windstar Cruises to find a cruise, plan your journey, look for specials, or<a href="https://www.windstarcruises.com/yachts/" target="_blank"> dream about the yachts</a>!</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_540" style="display:none"><p>Seafaring gamblers in the Nordic region, especially the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, have been enjoying the gambling services of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paf</a> on Tallink and Silja line cruises for over three decades. The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>
<p>Costa Cruises brand currently operates six casino ships and 8 vessels without gaming facilities. All sail under the Italian flag in the waters of the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, and South America. None of the casino spaces are huge by international standards but all are well appointed and offer tables and slots. The <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-mediterranea-2160.html">Mediterranea</a>, sailing out of Savona in Italy, offers the most slots with over 140 machines, while the <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-atlantica-2156.html">Atlantica</a>, departing from Tianjin, China offers the most table games with a count of 21.</p>
<p>The table game selection varies by ship but you will usually find blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as craps on some vessels.</p>
<p>All of the vessels offer fine dining, recreation, entertainment, shopping, sport, and wellness facilities including spas. Some of the ships without casino feature 4D Cinema as part of the kids' package of family fun.</p>
<p>Some of the amenities found on Costa Cruises Fortuna, sailing out of Port Rashid, Dubai, United Arab Emirates include a theater, library, art gallery, cognac bar and a cigar bar. Dining ranges from casual to fine dining on all vessels with 7-Michelin starred chef's tending to your needs on some.</p>
<p>For those who smoke and those who prefer not to be exposed, all cabins and public rooms are smoke-free. There are designated spaces on open decks for smokers and you can smoke on your private cabin balcony - and of course, in the Cigar Bar. e-cigarettes are in your cabin as well.</p>
<p>neoClassica and neoRomantica sail out of Mumbai, India and Port Louis, Mauritius respectively and offer a good variety of gaming.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_882" style="display:none"><p>Crystal Cruises is an American luxury liner with two casino outfitted ships as of 2018. Formerly owned and operated by Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) with Caesars Casinos onboard, the line was sold to <a href="owners/genting-hong-kong.html">Genting Hong Kong</a> in 2015.

Starting out with Britain's first transatlantic steamship mail contract, there are now three vessels in operation offering Northern European, Mediterranean, Transatlantic, Caribbean, and World Cruises.</p>
<p>The fleet currently consists of the ocean liner <a href="casino/queen-mary-2-2206.html">Queen Mary 2</a>, and cruise ships <a href="casino/cunard-line-queen-elizabeth-2-2165.html">Queen Elizabeth</a> and <a href="casino/cunard-cruises-queen-victoria.html">Queen Victoria</a>. A 4th vessel is slated for operation n 2022. There is a casino on board each Cunard ship. However, not all cruises offer gambling as the Empire Casinos do not open during voyages without foreign ports of call on the itinerary. Vessels stopping in Dublin, Cobh, St Peters Port and all foreign country ports will sail outside of UK territorial waters (12 miles/45 minutes) and the casinos will be opened while outside of the UKGC's jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>Queen Mary 2</strong> offers Roulette, Blackjack, Three card poker, and Heads up Texas Hold'em - a house-banked casino game played against the dealer - as well as about 100 slot machines. There are 9 gaming tables in total aboard QM2. As mention, the casino opens about 45 minutes after leaving port. Once out to sea, slots machines are available for play beginning at 10am.

The <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-regatta-2197.html">MS Regatta</a> was launched in 2003 and last refurbished in 2014.

The 6-month world cruises began in 2015. Bookings for the 180-Day World Cruises are taken up to two years in advance.</p>

The original company was founded in 1837 and the first passenger cruises from Southampton were offered in 1844.

If you don't see the game when aboard the <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-arcadia.html">Arcadia</a> and there is an empty blackjack table, ask your host to flip the table as the Fun 21 felt is just underneath. Purchase your chips from the dealer with cash or your cruise card. All winnings are cashed out onto your cruise card.</p>

Opening times can vary by jurisdiction, but the demarcation point is usually 12 miles outside of port limits.</p>
<p>Be sure to cash in your chips before leaving the ship. If you happen to forget, you can bring them along for your next voyage but may meet delays while the chips are authenticated.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_877" style="display:none"><p>Princess Cruises launched their first Mexican Riviera cruise in 1965 but didn't become a household name known to people who vacation at sea until about a decade later when the company was acquired by P&amp;O, who at the time was the world's largest oceanic shipper with more 300 vessels in operation. Baby boomers may recall <a href="casino/princess-cruises-island-princess-2024.html">Island Princess</a> and <a href="casino/princess-cruises-pacific-princess-2025.html">Pacific Princess</a> as the ships featured in the 1970s television series, The Love Boat.</p>

<p>USA Today has awarded Princess the accolade of "Best cruise lines for Gamblers" and slots fans are frequently offered high return tournaments like the $200,000 Monopoly Cruise for Cash tournament.

Table games can include heads-up Texas Hold ‘Em poker, and casino games like Caribbean Stud Poker, Three Card Poker and Let it Ride.

<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Seabourn is a luxury cruise liner...</strong></p>

<li>Formal nights are optional so you could save on wardrobe costs</li>
<li>Prices are all-inclusive so your drinks are paid for</li>
<li>Gourmands will especially appreciate Restaurant 2</li>

The company is headquartered in <a href="monaco.html">Monaco</a> and owned in the majority (67%) by <a href="owners/royal-caribbean-cruises.html">Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd</a>.</p>
<p>The company's current fleet comprises nine vessels. The largest and newest ship is Silver Muse at 40,700 gross tons and capacity for nearly 600 passengers. Six of the ships are over sixteen tons and three are clippers in the company's Expedition fleet.</p>

<p>There are no gaming facilities on the smaller expedition class ships.</p>
<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>

<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package.

<p>If you've ever been on a gambling ship, as opposed to a luxury cruise liner with a casino...</p>
<p><strong>You might ask:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I thought gambling was a monopoly in Florida. How do they do it?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, most of the <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots">slots</a> and table games are in the <a href="florida.html">Seminole Tribe's Hard Rock casinos</a>. You can find poker and a few <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">other games like poker</a> at <a href="florida.html">Florida racetracks</a> and jai alai frontons.</p>
<p>Once the ship enters international waters, Florida gambling laws no longer apply.</p>
<p>The 3-mile journey usually takes about 30 minutes - then the games are on!</p>

<p>This is a gambling ship <br />You'll be out to sea for 5-6 hours <br />People smoke outside, so you might smell it</p>
<p><strong>You might say:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Okay, I get it. But what about the casino... is it a real casino?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>
<p>It's a real casino alright. There are over 600 slots so there should always be some open. On a busy cruise, they'll open up to 100 gaming tables. That puts it on par with most Downtown Las Vegas properties and quite a few on the Strip.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you can play...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slots</li>
<li>Blackjack $5-$500 - dealer stands all 17's - BJ pays 3:2</li>

<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>Visit Windstar Cruises to find a cruise, plan your journey, look for specials, or<a href="https://www.windstarcruises.com/yachts/" target="_blank"> dream about the yachts</a>!</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_540" style="display:none"><p>Seafaring gamblers in the Nordic region, especially the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, have been enjoying the gambling services of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paf</a> on Tallink and Silja line cruises for over three decades. The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>
<p>Costa Cruises brand currently operates six casino ships and 8 vessels without gaming facilities. All sail under the Italian flag in the waters of the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, and South America. None of the casino spaces are huge by international standards but all are well appointed and offer tables and slots. The <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-mediterranea-2160.html">Mediterranea</a>, sailing out of Savona in Italy, offers the most slots with over 140 machines, while the <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-atlantica-2156.html">Atlantica</a>, departing from Tianjin, China offers the most table games with a count of 21.</p>
<p>The table game selection varies by ship but you will usually find blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as craps on some vessels.</p>
<p>All of the vessels offer fine dining, recreation, entertainment, shopping, sport, and wellness facilities including spas. Some of the ships without casino feature 4D Cinema as part of the kids' package of family fun.</p>
<p>Some of the amenities found on Costa Cruises Fortuna, sailing out of Port Rashid, Dubai, United Arab Emirates include a theater, library, art gallery, cognac bar and a cigar bar. Dining ranges from casual to fine dining on all vessels with 7-Michelin starred chef's tending to your needs on some.</p>
<p>For those who smoke and those who prefer not to be exposed, all cabins and public rooms are smoke-free. There are designated spaces on open decks for smokers and you can smoke on your private cabin balcony - and of course, in the Cigar Bar. e-cigarettes are in your cabin as well.</p>
<p>neoClassica and neoRomantica sail out of Mumbai, India and Port Louis, Mauritius respectively and offer a good variety of gaming.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_882" style="display:none"><p>Crystal Cruises is an American luxury liner with two casino outfitted ships as of 2018.

<p>You might be asking yourself:</p>
<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Seabourn is a luxury cruise liner...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect to pay top price for your cruise</li>
<li>Formal nights are optional so you could save on wardrobe costs</li>
<li>Prices are all-inclusive so your drinks are paid for</li>
<li>Gourmands will especially appreciate Restaurant 2</li>

<p>The company's current fleet comprises nine vessels. The largest and newest ship is Silver Muse at 40,700 gross tons and capacity for nearly 600 passengers. Six of the ships are over sixteen tons and three are clippers in the company's Expedition fleet.</p>

<p>There are no gaming facilities on the smaller expedition class ships.</p>
<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>

<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package.

<p><strong>You might ask:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I thought gambling was a monopoly in Florida. How do they do it?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, most of the <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots">slots</a> and table games are in the <a href="florida.html">Seminole Tribe's Hard Rock casinos</a>. You can find poker and a few <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">other games like poker</a> at <a href="florida.html">Florida racetracks</a> and jai alai frontons.</p>
<p>Once the ship enters international waters, Florida gambling laws no longer apply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"Okay, I get it. But what about the casino... is it a real casino?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>
<p>It's a real casino alright. There are over 600 slots so there should always be some open. On a busy cruise, they'll open up to 100 gaming tables. That puts it on par with most Downtown Las Vegas properties and quite a few on the Strip.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you can play...</strong></p>

<li>Slots</li>
<li>Blackjack $5-$500 - dealer stands all 17's - BJ pays 3:2</li>

It is acceptable for residents to access certain sports betting sites, the national lottery, and to bet on horse races online. Any other form of online gambling is difficult to accomplish as payment processors have been called on to stop issuing payments.

            <p>
East Asia encompasses the countries of China, the <!img src="images/allflags/ph.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Philippines flag"> <!a href="philippines.html">Philippines</a>, South Korea, Japan and others on the mainland as well as the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong; Malaysia, and Singapore along with far-flung places like the Maldives and the British Indian Ocean Territory where there are no casinos as there are none in Indonesia.
</p>

<p>
By far, the most important economic center of casino activity in the world is <img src="images/allflags/mo.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Macao flag"> <a href="macau.html">Macau</a>. Yearly revenues dwarf those of even Las Vegas, but it&#039;s not the only important gambling mecca in the region.
</p>

<p>
Two major casinos opened in <img src="images/allflags/sg.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Singapore flag"> <a href="singapore.html">Singapore</a> in 2010 - Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa with nearly a quarter million square feet of gaming space between them. Resorts World Genting nearly matches that and features the world&#039;s largest hotel. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/allflags/kr.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="South Korea flag"> <a href="south-korea.html">South Korea</a> is a major player in its own right between Jeju Island and Hard Rock International&#039;s $5 billion <a href="casino/inspire-integrated-resort.html">integrated casino resort</a> opening next to the Seoul Incheon International Airport. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/allflags/vn.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Vietnam flag"> <a href="vietnam.html">Vietnam</a> now allows its citizens to play in some casinos there and is seeing major, multi-billion dollar investments in casino resorts in metropolitan areas and beachside in the outlying provinces.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/allflags/jp.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Japan flag"> <a href="japan.html">Japan</a> has the potential to outstrip Macau revenues by some projections but as of late 2017, lawmakers have not yet decided on the regulatory framework or casino density and other rules, leaving the country&#039;s eventual economic importance an open question. Until plans are firmed up, licenses awarded, and business plans released, you can explore all of the <a href="japan.html">horse racing venues of Japan</a>.
</p>

<p>
Although Macau has implemented planned growth and requires alternative entertainment in all new development, one synergy most of East Asia lacks is a harmonious relationship between family tourism and casino gambling. Most of the great tourist attractions of the region lack casinos. There are casinos in <img src="images/allflags/np.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Nepal flag"> <a href="nepal.html">Nepal</a>, but Indonesia is bereft and the powers that be in Mongolia have yet to create a pathway for the industry to make inroads and fatten their coffers with much-needed gambling revenues.
</p>

<p>
The <img src="images/allflags/ph.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Philippines flag"> <a href="philippines.html">Philippines</a> has created their own "mini-Macau" and development is proceeding away from the urban centers and <a href="casino/solaire-quezon-city.html">away from Metro Manila</a>. The most phenomenal growth in East Asian gambling has actually been online. Although the markets are grey and even black - Chinese, Singaporean and Malaysian online customers are flocking to online casinos and sports betting sites whenever they can figure out how to get their money into and out of the casinos.

            <h3><a href="region/western-europe.html">Western Europe Casinos and Gambling</a></h3>
            <p>

Most Western European countries attempt to abide by guidelines adopted by the European Commission when updating their gambling laws. In practice, individual nations are free to establish governmental or private monopolies or allow for more than one operator to be licensed. 

</p>

<p>

Pre-Brexit, the <img src="images/allflags/gb.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="United Kingdom flag">
 UK already had a robust regulatory framework with stringent controls and licensing requirements through their Gambling Commission and the Gambling Act of 2005. The UKGC administers both online and terrestrial casinos and all other forms of betting in <a href="england.html">Great Britain</a> including the National Lottery, sports betting, and horse racing. However, cross-border protections are virtually non-existent. 

</p>

<p>

To date, there has been no EU legislation passed that deals specifically with gambling, so individual countries enact their own laws and legislation, mostly in accord with the EU&#039;s suggested framework. Most of the EU&#039;s focus is on internet gambling as that is the sector that reaches across borders.

</p>

<p>

<img src="images/allflags/fr.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="France flag"> <a href="france.html">France</a> has a long history of gambling and is home to a thriving casino industry. Most of the casinos are located in the south. See a <a href="france%23map.html">map and list</a> of all French casinos. Online operators licensed in France are not allowed to offer casino gambling. The people of France simply choose <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/france">online casinos</a> from the world at large.  <img src="images/allflags/mc.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Monaco flag"> Monaco has its own government, gambling laws, and illustrious casinos.

</p>

<p>

The Spanish Gambling Act of 2011 covers betting in all 17 autonomous communities of <img src="images/allflags/es.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Spain flag"> Spain. The <a href="spain/lottery.html">El Gordo lottery</a> “el Sorteo Extraordinario de Navidad” is big business and online gambling is booming especially football betting. The land casinos of Spain see heavy footfall from citizens and visitors alike. There is virtually no region in Spain without a casino.

</p>

<p>

<img src="images/allflags/gi.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Gibraltar flag"> Gibraltar, <img src="images/allflags/mt.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Malta flag"> Malta and a few other Mediterranean area countries have casinos as well.

<img src="images/allflags/de.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Germany flag"> Germany has casinos in more than <a href="germany%23map.html">50 cities</a> along with thousands of slots in various pubs across the country. While poker and slots are everywhere, Germans seem to be most interested in <a href="articles/the-basics-of-sports-betting.html">sports betting</a>. Great cities like Berlin and Munich host grand casinos, as well as electronic gaming parlors and the country&#039;s perimeter has plenty of casinos near the borders.


</p>

<p>

Most of the Nordic countries allow gambling, but betting in <img src="images/allflags/no.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Norway flag"> Norway is tightly controlled with no real casinos there. As much as the peoples enjoy gambling, most of it occurs online in the north.

<p>

Lotteries are offered throughout the continent. Click <a href="lottery.html">here</a> for more information on el Gordo, Euro Million and all the world&#039;s lotteries.

<p>

Poker remains popular in Western European card rooms and casinos and more countries are opening their player pools to shared liquidity - yet the dreamed of EU-wide poker room still does not exist.

<h3>North America Casinos and Gambling</h3>
<p>World Casino Directory gives full attention to the most active casino continent in the world, <a href="region/north-america.html">North America</a>. More than a quarter of the world&#039;s casinos are in the<img src="images/allflags/us.gif" alt="USA flag" width="16" height="11" /><a href="united-states.html">USA</a>.</p>
<p>It all started in <a href="nevada/las-vegas.html">Las Vegas</a> in the 1930&#039;s but <a href="new-jersey/atlantic-city.html">Atlantic City</a> began sharing the spotlight in the 1970&#039;s followed by a little town called <a href="south-dakota/deadwood.html">Deadwood, South Dakota</a> in the 80&#039;s and then the <a>Gulf Coast</a> in the 90&#039;s. Now there are casinos and card clubs in every state except Utah and Hawaii.</p>
<p>In spite of the vast numbers, the location of casinos in the USA is very specific. Aside from tribal casinos on reservation lands, the only states to allow gambling statewide are <a href="nevada.html">Nevada</a> and <a href="louisiana.html">Louisiana</a>. All other states restrict gambling to specific areas - like Atlantic City, in New Jersey and sometimes to riverboats or racetracks in other states.</p>
<p>While gambling itself is legal under the federal law of the United States, there are certain restrictions for interstate and online gambling. To be more precise, the Federal Wire Act of 1961 banned interstate wagering on sports, but without addressing other forms of gambling. In addition to this, the Unlawful <strong>Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA)</strong> did not specifically prohibit online gambling either but vetoed financial transactions involving online gambling service providers.</p>
<p>While this resulted in a number of operators ceasing their activities in this market, the others decided to stay and continue serving local clientele. California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia are <a href="usonlinecasinos.html">US states where online gambling is fully legal</a>, but the list of states accepting it keeps on growing.</p>
<p>Compared to other corners of the world, the list of providers is somewhat limited, yet there&rsquo;s more than enough to choose from. Some of the most popular US-friendly online games providers are <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/realtime-gaming">Realtime Gaming (RTG)</a>, Rival, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/betsoft-gaming">BetSoft</a>, Saucify, Nucleus Gaming, Vista Gaming, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/slotland-entertainment">Slotland</a>, Arrows Edge, and others.</p>
<p>Pari-mutuel facilities are available in the U.S. hosting events like jai alai, horse racing, and some greyhound races.</p>
<p>Nearly every state in the U.S. has a lottery. Check in on USA lottery results <a href="united-states/lottery.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="images/allflags/ca.gif" alt="Canada flag" width="16" height="11" /><a href="canada.html">Canada</a> has over 100 casinos and slot parlors. The larger properties offer slots, craps, roulette, keno, blackjack, baccarat and more. Many of the slot parlors are located at horse racing facilities and slot revenues help to keep the pari-mutuel industry healthy.</p>
<p>Integrated casino resorts are opening from <a href="british-columbia/vancouver.html">Vancouver</a>, British Columbia to the Greater Toronto Area in the province of <a href="ontario.html">Ontario</a>. Canadians take great pride in their local fare so be sure to visit fine dining establishments in the casinos. B.C. casinos offer fresh Pacific seafood and the casinos in <a href="quebec.html">Quebec</a> offer French Canadian cuisine from poutines to gourmet seven-course meals.</p>
<p>Online casinos generally offer the same odds and better payback percentages than land-based casinos in Canada. If you&rsquo;re a Canadian looking to play online, <a href="https://www.canadiancasinos.ca/">CanadianCasinos</a> has a lot of knowledge about Canadian online casinos and bring you fair and trustworthy information about the online gaming scene in Canada.</p>
<p>As for the online gambling market, Ontario opened its door to this form of entertainment on April 4, 2022. The body in charge of governing this sector is the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) in cooperation with iGaming Ontario established in July 2021.</p>
<p>Aside from the stringent licensing procedure, operators need to comply with the set of technical requirements to be able to operate in this Canadian province. Some of those requirements include a ban on auto-play for slots and the minimum spin speed limited to 2.5 seconds.</p>
<p>Ever since the market went live, numerous software providers received licenses to enter Ontario, with new ones being welcomed regularly. Some of the companies greenlighted for this market include <a href="https://news.worldcasinodirectory.com/evolution-celebrates-another-momentous-launch-in-canada-takes-igaming-content-live-in-ontario-with-multiple-operator-partners-100884">Evolution</a>, Playtech, <a href="https://news.worldcasinodirectory.com/armadillo-studios-now-certified-to-offer-online-gaming-services-in-ontario-101629">Armadillo Studios</a>, Wazdan, Quickspin, Kalamba, <a href="https://news.worldcasinodirectory.com/wizard-games-rolls-out-igaming-content-in-newly-regulated-ontario-market-goes-live-with-scandinavian-operator-paf-101037">Wizard Games</a> and others.</p>

<p><img src="images/allflags/mx.gif" alt="Mexico flag" width="16" height="11" /><a href="mexico.html">Mexico</a> has seen a boom in their casino industry over the last decade. There are now more than 300 casinos and others could be coming to resort areas like Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San Lucas. You&#039;ll find everything from slot parlors with sports books to full-scale casinos. Every Mexican state offers some form of gambling. Many of the regional casino operators also offer online gaming. Click to see a map of all the <a href="mexico%23map.html">casinos in Mexico</a>.</p>

            <h3>South America Casinos and Gambling</h3>
            <p>

South America lies mostly in the southern hemisphere with part of Brazil and a handful of other countries being situated above the equator. Parts of <img src="images/allflags/ve.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Venezuela flag"> Venezuela and <img src="images/allflags/co.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Colombia flag"> <a href="colombia.html">Colombia</a> have shorelines on the Caribbean Sea with the rest of the continent surrounded by the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Most of the nicer casinos are on or near the seaside with <img src="images/allflags/ar.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Argentina flag"> Argentina leading the way in casino development, including gaming venues spread throughout the interior.

<p>

</p>

<img src="images/allflags/cl.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Chile flag"> Chile has a long coastline on the Pacific side to the west and is also seeing a lot of new development. <img src="images/allflags/br.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Brazil flag"> Brazil sees more tourists than any other Latin American country and is the largest nation in South America, but there are no casinos there. Along with Brazil&#039;s Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo who receive nearly 4 million foreign visitors each year - arrivals in <a href="argentina/buenos-aires.html">Buenos Aires, Argentina</a> and Colombian cities like Bogota also greatly contribute to the nearly 100 million who come to Latin America every year.

<p>

</p>

<img src="images/allflags/ec.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Ecuador flag"> Ecuador is a beautiful country with coastal wonders, cultural wealth, the Galápagos Islands and interior geography that will take visitors from the Amazon rain forest into the high Andes - but there have been no casinos there for a few years.

<p>

</p>

<img src="images/allflags/py.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Paraguay flag"> <a href="paraguay.html">Paraguay</a> and <img src="images/allflags/uy.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Uruguay flag"> <a href="uruguay.html">Uruguay</a> have a few nice casinos with some in operation for over a hundred years. Aside from <img src="images/allflags/pe.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Peru flag"> Peru&#039;s mixture of high class casino hotels and the slightly scary little hole in the wall slot parlors and illegal casinos, there isn&#039;t much of a gambling industry in the smaller countries like <img src="images/allflags/gy.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Guyana flag"> Guyana, <img src="images/allflags/gf.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="French Guiana flag"> French Guiana, or the

Travel to the interior is not suggested but a vigilant visitor will find some great gaming in the capital city.

<p>

</p>

The two must-visit casinos are located on opposite sides of the continent. Casino Ovalle in <a href="chile.html">Chile</a> is newer and well managed while the impressive Trilenium Casino in <a href="argentina/tigre.html">Tigre, Argentina</a> offers everything you&#039;d expect from a Las Vegas casino resort including about a quarter million sq ft of gaming space spread over three levels, a poker room, fine dining, nightlife, and entertainment. It&#039;s a huge complex surrounded by a theater, amusement park, water park, and an outdoor amphitheater that hosts top Latin acts. Take a brief walk to visit China Town Tigre for out of this world street food, and a shopping mall selling Asian goods.

            <h3><a href="region/oceania.html">Oceania Casinos / Australasia Gambling</a></h3>

<p>
Oceania is a vast region covering 8,525,989 sqm (3.292 million sq miles) that encompasses Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia with a total population of over 40 million.
</p>

<p>
Australia, New Zealand, the Commonwealth of <a href="northern-mariana-islands.html"><img src="images/allflags/mp.gif"> Northern Mariana Islands</a> (CNMI), Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Samoa are the most important countries regarding gambling in the region. Australia reigns supreme for the volume of players and casinos, but the single highest grossing tables on the planet are to be found in <a href="saipan.html">Saipan</a> at a casino operated by former Macau junket operator Imperial Pacific.
</p>

<p>
<a href="australia.html"><img src="images/allflags/au.gif"> Australia</a> is the home of Crown Resorts and the Packer legacy. In early 2017 James Packer pulled out of his company&#039;s partnership with Lawrence Ho&#039;s Melco, leaving China&#039;s playground of Macau to focus all of his efforts on his homeland. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to Crown Melbourne Entertainment Complex and Crown Perth Entertainment Complex, the company is building a massive <a href="casino/crown-sydney-au.html">integrated resort in Sydney</a> at Barangaroo. The other major players in Australia are Star (Echo) Entertainment and Skycity Entertainment Group. Star is part of a consortium developing <a href="casino/the-star-brisbane.html">Star Brisbane</a> with the help of Asian investors.
</p>

<p>
Australia also accounts for a large portion of world online gambling revenue even though there are no online casinos licensed there or regulated by the government. Australian players will always find a venue and a few private companies stepped up when the publically traded poker and casino sites pulled out with an amended law in 2017.
</p>

<p>
Skycity operates half of the casinos in <a href="new-zealand.html"><img src="images/allflags/nz.gif"> New Zealand</a>. 
</p>

<p>
About 1,750 km east of Australia you&#039;ll find <a href="vanuatu.html"><img src="images/allflags/vu.gif"> Vanuatu</a> with oceanside casino gambling and a growing online presence. <a href="new-caledonia.html"><img src="images/allflags/nc.gif"> New Caledonia</a> is one of the only French territories that offer casino gambling, even though many others could become licensed under current law. <a href="samoa.html"><img src="images/allflags/ws.gif"> Samoa</a> is the home to one casino with a sister-site struggling for years to open.
</p>

<p>
Not mentioned earlier are the Solomon Islands which also hosts casinos in the capital city. Most people travel there to visit the War Museum, and surf or scuba dive in Gizo or Malaita. 
</p>

<p>
The entire region is a tourism mecca with literally thousands of islands to visit, each with their own rich culture and geography. For anyone who wishes they could go to some deserted tropical island, the South Pacific is definitely the place to look for one.

Of course you would never travel to South Sudan or Western Sahara expecting to gamble with anything but your life, but <img src="images/allflags/ma.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Morocco flag"> <a href="morocco.html">Morocco</a> presents perfectly viable options as do some interior countries such as <img src="images/allflags/zw.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Zimbabwe flag"> <a href="zimbabwe.html">Zimbabwe</a> and <img src="images/allflags/bw.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Botswana flag"> <a href="botswana.html">Botswana</a>.

Tourism supports about 10% of the jobs in SA with diverse offerings from the Cape to Kruger Park in the northern part of the country. Casinos can be found at safari parks, but ecotourism is becoming increasingly popular as well. The country boasts eight UNESCO World Heritage sites including uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park in KwaZulu-Natal and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park.
</p>

<p>
Many of the casinos are family-friendly destinations with all-ages entertainment and child care facilities so the parents can gamble while the children play in a safe and supervised environment.

            <h3><a href="region/central-asia.html">Central Asian Casinos and Gambling</a></h3>
           <p>
Central Asia comprises a dozen countries and several of them offer legal gambling opportunities. Obviously, the Muslim dominated countries such as Pakistan or Tajikistan do not allow gambling, and Afghanistan wouldn&#039;t be a good bet even if peace were the order of the day there.
</p>

<p>
However, in <img src="images/allflags/kz.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Kazakhstan flag"> <a href="kazakhstan.html">Kazakhstan</a> there is a thriving casino industry albeit confined to certain semi-remote gambling zones.

<img src="images/allflags/am.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Armenia flag"> <a href="armenia.html">Armenia</a> has a handful of casinos, mostly catering to local clientele but some do draw money from Russian visitors.

</p>

<p>
The biggest Central Asian gambling market is most certainly <img src="images/allflags/in.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="India flag"> <a href="india.html">India</a> with the country&#039;s rising middle class and new elites finding enjoyment in online casinos and gambling floors next to and in luxury hotels. Some online betting is legal there but most of it occurs without government permission. Indians love sports betting more than almost any other form of gambling.  A few land casinos are in operation with no croupiers or dealers but the dealer-staffed gambling boats with landbased luxury hotels do big business. 
</p>

<p>
Gambling law is in constant turmoil with commercial and ideological factions inside and outside the Indian government locked in mortal embrace year after year. There are several casinos just across the border in <img src="images/allflags/np.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Nepal flag"> <a href="nepal.html">Nepal</a> that attract a lot of business from India.

Although the casinos of Central Asia are not well-known globally, the industry is alive and well there and growing at a slow and steady pace.

            <h3>Casinos of Central America</h3>

<p>

The World Casino Directory covers the casinos of Central America from the <img src="images/allflags/mx.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Mexico flag"> Mexican border in the north to the Panama Canal to the south. Casinos of the Caribbean are listed <a href="region/caribbean.html">here</a>.

</p>

<p>

You will find Central American casinos to have a unique atmosphere to them and of course, they offer all your favorite casino games. <img src="images/allflags/cr.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Costa Rica flag"> <a href="costa-rica.html">Costa Rica</a> is one of the most popular Central American gambling and tourist destinations with more casinos than any other country in the region. Most of them are located along the Pacific coast, but there are some on the Atlantic side of the isthmus too.

</p>

<p>

The <a href="panama.html">casinos of Panama</a> are the largest in the region and most of them were developed after the turn of the 21st Century. Panama City is home to the Ocean Sun Casino at Trump Tower and other first-class venues, but you&#039;ll find them in Santiago, David, and other <img src="images/allflags/pa.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Panama flag"> Panama cities as well. The Veneto Wyndham Grand Hotel & Casino on Morales Ave in the capital offers over 600 machines and almost 50 gaming tables including poker. 

</p>

<p>

<img src="images/allflags/bz.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Belize flag"> <a href="belize.html">Belize</a>, <img src="images/allflags/sv.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="El Salvador flag"> El Salvador, <img src="images/allflags/gt.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Guatemala flag"> Guatemala, <img src="images/allflags/hn.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Honduras flag"> Honduras, and <img src="images/allflags/ni.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Nicaragua flag"> Nicaragua all have casinos even though some are not licensed or otherwise regulated. If you stay in tourist-populated areas or where there are a good number of ex-pats, most of the casinos in the smaller Central American countries are perfectly safe and enjoyable to visit.

</p>

<p>

While there is always some underground rumble about certain Eastern European &#039;bad actors&#039; influencing casino operations further south, such as in <img src="images/allflags/bo.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Bolivia flag"> Bolivia - that&#039;s not been the case in places like Belize. The highly respected Princess International, with casino and hotel properties throughout the Caribbean and Europe, operates the largest casino in Belize City - the Princess Hotel and Casino.

</p>

<p>

The Fantastic brand has a few nice gambling rooms in <a href="guatemala.html">Guatemala</a>, they are usually located on the upper floors of malls and shopping centers. Princess runs a 20,000 sq ft "Video Loteria" in Guatemala City with VIP areas and a poker room. Crowne Plaza offers tables and slots as well as accommodations.

</p>

<p>

The poker scene in Central America is simply to transient to describe, but for the most part, your best bets are San Jose in Costa Rica and Panama City. Inquire before you go or ask around once you get there, but stick to the <a href="panama/poker-rooms.html">licensed rooms</a>, in quality casinos to stay on the safe side.

</p>

<p>

For pari-mutuel betting, Hipodromo Presidente Remon in <a href="panama/panama-city.html">Panama City</a> offers racing that is as good as it gets anywhere on earth. The facilities are owned by Codere Group who also have a casino there with about 250 slot machines and 25 gaming tables.

            <h3><a href="cruise-ships.html">Casino Cruise Ships - Oceanliner Casinos</a></h3>
            
<p>

Casino cruise ships offer people in almost every jurisdiction the opportunity to gamble at sea. Cruise ships typically sail 7 miles offshore into international waters, so the casinos on them are unregulated venues and not subject to the laws of any given country. Many ships offer slots, and some offer virtually every game you would find in Las Vegas or Macau. 

</p>

<p>

In some locales, cruise ships offer the only hope for vacationers who want to gamble, but may not want to or be able to travel a long distance to a city that offers gambling. Blackjack, roulette, poker, and slots are standard on almost every vessel. Table limits can be as low as $1 for blackjack or 25 cents for roulette (Cunard Line) while Royal Caribbeans&#039; Allure and Seabourn specialty cruises offer high limit tables.

</p>

<p>

Some casino cruise ships are small crafts with one or two tables and two walls of slot machines sailing out of U.S. ports. There are also luxurious, private residential casino super ships like the upcoming <a href="casino/crusino.html">Crusino</a> with 200,000 square feet (17,650 sqm) of gambling space over two full decks. One supership sailing today is Royal Caribbean&#039;s <a href="casino/royal-caribbean-oasis-of-the-seas.html">Oasis of the Sea</a>; a 1,000-foot long ship boasting an 18,000 square foot casino complete with about 500 slot machines and 27 gaming tables, along with all of the entertainment you would expect at an integrated resort casino.

</p>

<p>

Smoking is permitted in many casinos at sea, but non-smoking areas, including outdoor gaming areas, are usually provided. It is easy enough for non-smokers to find non-smoking excursions. The minimum age to gamble is 18 on most ships, but some <img src="images/allflags/au.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Australia flag"> Australian, <img src="images/allflags/gb.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="United Kingdom flag"> UK, <img src="images/allflags/jp.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Japan flag"> Japanese, Caribbean, and <img src="images/allflags/us.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="United States flag"> US sailings restrict gaming to guests 21 and older. Some of the more upscale casinos offer pre-approved lines of credit, all accept cash, and some allow you to use your onboard account for gambling.

</p>

<p>

The one cruise line you will not find to offer gaming on any ship is Disney. The cruises are among the most expensive family-friendly voyages, but the adult-only sections are well accoutered and include pools and restaurants/lounges.

</p>

<p>

Because ports of call change so frequently you will need to find up to the minute information to book a cruise. Check out our <a href="cruise-ships.html">cruise ship gambling guide</a> to learn more.

            <h3><a href="region/eastern-europe.html">Eastern Europe Casinos and Gambling</a></h3>
            <p>
Eastern Europe has a burgeoning casino industry online and on-land. Most EE countries are members of the European Union, and as such, they operate as their Western neighbors do by creating and enforcing their own gambling laws while trying to follow the EU and EC guidance for cross-border economic equality with regard to online gambling regulation.
</p>

<p>
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was a period of disarray and refocusing as countries like <img src="images/allflags/by.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Belarus flag"> <a href="belarus.html">Belarus</a>, <img src="images/allflags/ro.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Romania flag"> <a href="romania.html"></a>Romania, and <img src="images/allflags/ee.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Estonia flag"> <a href="estonia.html">Estonia</a> asserted their independence and began focusing efforts on capturing revenues and providing regulatory frameworks in order to attract gambling businesses. By the mid-2010s a robust industry was seen to begin phenomenal growth.
</p>

<p>
Countries like <img src="images/allflags/al.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Albania flag"> <a href="albania.html">Albania</a> have always had casinos but in 2005 the country&#039;s first legal casino opened in the capital city of Tirana following a 20-million-euro investment by Hyatt Regency. Eight million of that was for a 15 year license. A new law in 2015 saw an explosion in the growth of small club casinos by Astra and Admiral with over 50 venues in operation a scant two years later.
</p>

<p>
After outlawing casinos earlier, <img src="images/allflags/ru.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Russia flag"> <a href="russia.html">Russia</a> has opened a few of its gambling zones and the original Azov City casinos will close by January 1, 2019, in favor of the Sochi zone. The Primorye Entertainment Zone outside of Vladivostok has struggled to reach its potential but still attracts high-value players from the heretofore untapped northern Chinese market.

            <h3><a href="region/middle-east.html">Middle East Casinos and Gambling</a></h3>
           <p>

The Middle East is not known as a tourist destination for gambling. Of the sixteen countries that we place in the region, only two have licensed operating casinos. Many do allow horse racing. However, legal betting may be another story.

</p>

<p>

<img src="images/allflags/eg.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Egypt flag"> <a href="egypt.html">Egypt</a> is a seemingly unlikely place to find luxury casinos but we count more than a dozen there with the lion&#039;s share of them located in the capital city of Cairo. <a href="egypt.html">Big international names</a> with casino properties in Egypt include Caesars Entertainment Corporation, the Genting Group, and London Clubs International. As of late 2017, there were no new major casino developments planned there, but the  Sheraton Cairo Hotel & Casino on the River Nile reopened in late 2017 after being refurbished to its former glory.

</p>

<p>

Egyptian tourism took a turn for the worse after the Arab Spring uprising in 2011 but the Sheraton&#039;s capital expenditures should give hope to other operators that the gambling portion of Egypt&#039;s economy can only improve. 

</p>

<p>

The lone casino in <img src="images/allflags/lb.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Lebanon flag"> <a href="lebanon.html">Lebanon</a> is <a href="casino/casino-du-liban-985.html">Casino du Liban</a>, located seaside about 14 miles outside the capital city of Beirut. It&#039;s a mid-sized casino by Las Vegas standards but large when compared to most European casinos with 400 slot machines and 60 gaming tables. The property sees quite a bit of action from visiting Israelis. US visitors are warned by the State Department to stay away from Lebanon and US Embassy staff are often forbidden to go to the casino due to unspecified threats.

</p>


<p>

Online gambling is strictly forbidden in most Middle Eastern countries with some dishing out harsh penalties to those who risk more than their gambling stakes by betting online. However, high rollers from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Israel are known to be whales at some online casinos and gamblers will always find a way and a place to play.

</p>

<p>

Horse racing is popular in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, <img src="images/allflags/tr.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Turkey flag"> <a href="turkey.html">Turkey</a>, and the <img src="images/allflags/ae.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="UAE flag"> <a href="united-arab-emirates.html">UAE</a> yet betting remains illegal. Some <a href="cruise-ships.html">casino cruise ships</a> do travel out of port from the Gulf states of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and once they are in the International Waters of the Arabian Sea, country-specific gambling laws are no longer in force.

</p>

<p>

Visitors can drill down through our Middle eastern database to a country and city they would like to know more about, finally ending up on a casino profile page listing everything from dining and entertainment opportunities to the number of machines and tables, as well as a direct link to book a hotel room if there are accommodations associated with the casino property.

            <h3>Caribbean Casinos and Gambling</h3>
           <p>

There are about 30 individual territories in the Caribbean region comprising over 700 islands, islets, reefs, and cays. Gambling laws, and therefore casino gaming opportunities are diverse among the various sovereign states, overseas departments, and dependencies of larger countries like the U.S., France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands. World Casino directory is here to guide you through them all from <img src="images/allflags/aw.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Aruba flag"> <a href="aruba.html">Aruba</a> to <img src="images/allflags/tc.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Turks and Caicos flag"> <a href="turks-and-caicos.html">Turks and Caicos</a> and beyond. You can use the drop-down below to read a little about each country and follow the links to more detailed descriptions of every casino in the Caribbean.

</p>

<p>

Most people visit the Caribbean for the spectacular blue waters, white or pink coral beach sands, and tropical climate. Most of the casinos are small affairs attached to or inside of beachfront hotels with a few dozen slot machines and a handful of table games - all you need after a long day snorkeling or beach combing.

</p>

<p>

Full-scale mega-resorts can be found as well. The first to open was Atlantis Paradise in the <img src="images/allflags/bs.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Bahamas flag"> <a href="bahamas.html">Bahamas</a> in 1998. The now nearly 4,000 room hotel and casino complex replaced another large casino on Paradise Island that opened in 1968. And after a decade of setbacks, Baha Mar finally opened in 2017 with a 100,000 sq ft casino. And while Resorts World Bimini&#039;s casino covers only 10,000 sq ft, you can run into some very high rollers there when management lifts the $10,000 per hand baccarat limits. <img src="images/allflags/jm.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Jamaica flag"> <a href="jamaica.html">Jamaica</a> is next in line for large scale development.

</p>

<p>

For a taste of Europe, you may want to visit the island of Sint Maarten - Saint Martin. The southern part of the island, Sint Maarten, is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands while the northern part of the island, Saint Martin, is a French overseas collectivity. It is rare to find a casino in any French collectivity; there are none in the Caribbean.

</p>

<p>

It&#039;s important to keep in mind that some of the economies in the region are extremely fragile. When calamities such as earthquakes, volcanoes, or hurricanes strike, it can take years or even decades for gambling facilities or entire tourist economies to recover if they ever do.

</p>

<p>

<img src="images/allflags/do.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Dominican Republic flag"> <a href="dominican-republic.html">Dominican Republic casinos</a> are certainly not a thing of the past, while neighboring <img src="images/allflags/ht.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Haiti flag"> Haiti may never see casino development again. The casinos that remain in <img src="images/allflags/pr.gif" width="16" height="11" alt="Puerto Rico flag"> <a href="puerto-rico.html">Puerto Rico</a> are struggling, but you&#039;ll still find a few nice ones.

</p>

<p>

Enjoy your journey through our Caribbean casino guide. If you visit an island nation without casinos and have good cellular service or Wifi, you can still play online on the beach or inside a comfortable hotel room after a long day on the beach.

        <div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_540" style="display:none"><p>Seafaring gamblers in the Nordic region, especially the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, have been enjoying the gambling services of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paf</a> on Tallink and Silja line cruises for over three decades. The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>
<p>Costa Cruises brand currently operates six casino ships and 8 vessels without gaming facilities. All sail under the Italian flag in the waters of the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, and South America. None of the casino spaces are huge by international standards but all are well appointed and offer tables and slots. The <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-mediterranea-2160.html">Mediterranea</a>, sailing out of Savona in Italy, offers the most slots with over 140 machines, while the <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-atlantica-2156.html">Atlantica</a>, departing from Tianjin, China offers the most table games with a count of 21.</p>
<p>The table game selection varies by ship but you will usually find blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as craps on some vessels.</p>
<p>All of the vessels offer fine dining, recreation, entertainment, shopping, sport, and wellness facilities including spas. Some of the ships without casino feature 4D Cinema as part of the kids' package of family fun.</p>
<p>Some of the amenities found on Costa Cruises Fortuna, sailing out of Port Rashid, Dubai, United Arab Emirates include a theater, library, art gallery, cognac bar and a cigar bar. Dining ranges from casual to fine dining on all vessels with 7-Michelin starred chef's tending to your needs on some.</p>
<p>For those who smoke and those who prefer not to be exposed, all cabins and public rooms are smoke-free. There are designated spaces on open decks for smokers and you can smoke on your private cabin balcony - and of course, in the Cigar Bar. e-cigarettes are in your cabin as well.</p>
<p>neoClassica and neoRomantica sail out of Mumbai, India and Port Louis, Mauritius respectively and offer a good variety of gaming.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_882" style="display:none"><p>Crystal Cruises is an American luxury liner with two casino outfitted ships as of 2018. Formerly owned and operated by Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) with Caesars Casinos onboard, the line was sold to <a href="owners/genting-hong-kong.html">Genting Hong Kong</a> in 2015. The casinos were rebranded as Resorts World casinos after Genting's other land-based casino brand.</p>
<p>The subsidiary was also renamed to Crystal, Ltd and maintains headquarters in Los Angeles, California, and Miami, Florida. Additional luxury brands in service or under development include Crystal River Cruises, Crystal Yacht Expedition Cruises, Crystal Luxury Air and Crystal AirCruises. Crystal Cruises is currently the only division to offer full-service onboard casino amenities.</p>

In October 2017 the Symphony emerged from a multimillion-dollar renovation with luxury suites and penthouses in addition to more standard accommodations. The 50,000-ton vessel formerly accommodated 1,000 passengers but now offers more space and luxury to just 848 guests over eight decks. The new deck configuration for Serenity unveiled in November 2018.</p>
<p>The Serenity offers 9 decks including the uppermost Sun Deck with elevator service.

Additional fine dining sees Prego bring the flavors of Italy to the Serenity. Every day dining is also available in the Crystal Dining Room with signature menus focused on two choices - one classic, the other, modern.</p>

Starting out with Britain's first transatlantic steamship mail contract, there are now three vessels in operation offering Northern European, Mediterranean, Transatlantic, Caribbean, and World Cruises.</p>
<p>The fleet currently consists of the ocean liner <a href="casino/queen-mary-2-2206.html">Queen Mary 2</a>, and cruise ships <a href="casino/cunard-line-queen-elizabeth-2-2165.html">Queen Elizabeth</a> and <a href="casino/cunard-cruises-queen-victoria.html">Queen Victoria</a>. A 4th vessel is slated for operation n 2022. There is a casino on board each Cunard ship. However, not all cruises offer gambling as the Empire Casinos do not open during voyages without foreign ports of call on the itinerary. Vessels stopping in Dublin, Cobh, St Peters Port and all foreign country ports will sail outside of UK territorial waters (12 miles/45 minutes) and the casinos will be opened while outside of the UKGC's jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>Queen Mary 2</strong> offers Roulette, Blackjack, Three card poker, and Heads up Texas Hold'em - a house-banked casino game played against the dealer - as well as about 100 slot machines. There are 9 gaming tables in total aboard QM2. As mention, the casino opens about 45 minutes after leaving port. Once out to sea, slots machines are available for play beginning at 10am. Tables are open from 11am until 5pm, and then again from 7:30pm until close. Closing time is at the discretion of the casino manager.</p>
<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth</strong> offers about 45 slot machines and 5 gaming tables. Available table games include Roulette, Blackjack, Three Card Poker, and Fun 21.</p>
<p><strong>Queen Victoria</strong> features about 45 slots and the same mix of games spread over 5 tables as are found on Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Table limits on all ships vary from $3 - $25 minimums with maximum bets ranging from $100 - $500. Reels slots, video slots, and video poker machines are multi-denominational with 'coin' sizes ranging from a penny to $5.</p>
<p>All machines are coinless. Deposits are accepted in notes or via cruise cards. Cashouts are done to your card. Cash and cards are accepted at the tables to purchase chips. A credit card must be registered at the front desk in order to use your cruise card for gambling. "Onboard spending money" is not accepted for chip purchases.</p>

<p>There are 4 ships in the Regatta class, all were built in 1998, 1999, or 2000. The <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-regatta-2197.html">MS Regatta</a> was launched in 2003 and last refurbished in 2014. The most recent launch in the class was the 30,277 ton, 343 cabin, <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-serina.html">MS Sirena</a>.

The 6-month world cruises began in 2015. Bookings for the 180-Day World Cruises are taken up to two years in advance.</p>

Purchase your chips from the dealer with cash or your cruise card. All winnings are cashed out onto your cruise card.</p>

If you happen to forget, you can bring them along for your next voyage but may meet delays while the chips are authenticated.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_877" style="display:none"><p>Princess Cruises launched their first Mexican Riviera cruise in 1965 but didn't become a household name known to people who vacation at sea until about a decade later when the company was acquired by P&amp;O, who at the time was the world's largest oceanic shipper with more 300 vessels in operation. Baby boomers may recall <a href="casino/princess-cruises-island-princess-2024.html">Island Princess</a> and <a href="casino/princess-cruises-pacific-princess-2025.html">Pacific Princess</a> as the ships featured in the 1970s television series, The Love Boat.</p>

<p>USA Today has awarded Princess the accolade of "Best cruise lines for Gamblers" and slots fans are frequently offered high return tournaments like the $200,000 Monopoly Cruise for Cash tournament.

<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>

The company is headquartered in <a href="monaco.html">Monaco</a> and owned in the majority (67%) by <a href="owners/royal-caribbean-cruises.html">Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd</a>.</p>
<p>The company's current fleet comprises nine vessels. The largest and newest ship is Silver Muse at 40,700 gross tons and capacity for nearly 600 passengers. Six of the ships are over sixteen tons and three are clippers in the company's Expedition fleet.</p>
<p>Seafaring gamblers will find casinos aboard:</p>

<p>There are no gaming facilities on the smaller expedition class ships.</p>
<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>
<p>You can click the following link to view the <a href="https://www.silversea.com/ships/silver-shadow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">casino aboard Silver Shadow</a>.</p>
<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package. If unsure of local laws, please wait until you are 12 miles out to sea before you <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/">gambling online</a>.</p>

<p>If you've ever been on a gambling ship, as opposed to a luxury cruise liner with a casino...</p>
<p><strong>You might ask:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I thought gambling was a monopoly in Florida. How do they do it?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, most of the <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots">slots</a> and table games are in the <a href="florida.html">Seminole Tribe's Hard Rock casinos</a>. You can find poker and a few <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">other games like poker</a> at <a href="florida.html">Florida racetracks</a> and jai alai frontons.</p>
<p>Once the ship enters international waters, Florida gambling laws no longer apply.</p>
<p>The 3-mile journey usually takes about 30 minutes - then the games are on!</p>
<h2>#1 Florida Casino Cruise?</h2>
<p>Judging by the reviews on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34117-d2229441-Reviews-Victory_Casino_Cruises-Cape_Canaveral_Brevard_County_Florida.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor</a>, most people are extremely satisfied with their Victory Casino Cruise experiences. Those who weren't might not have known what to expect.</p>
<p>This is a gambling ship <br />You'll be out to sea for 5-6 hours <br />People smoke outside, so you might smell it</p>
<p><strong>You might say:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Okay, I get it. But what about the casino... is it a real casino?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>
<p>It's a real casino alright. There are over 600 slots so there should always be some open. On a busy cruise, they'll open up to 100 gaming tables. That puts it on par with most Downtown Las Vegas properties and quite a few on the Strip.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you can play...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slots</li>
<li>Blackjack $5-$500 - dealer stands all 17's - BJ pays 3:2</li>
<li>Craps</li>
<li>Roulette</li>

<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>Visit Windstar Cruises to find a cruise, plan your journey, look for specials, or<a href="https://www.windstarcruises.com/yachts/" target="_blank"> dream about the yachts</a>!</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_540" style="display:none"><p>Seafaring gamblers in the Nordic region, especially the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, have been enjoying the gambling services of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paf</a> on Tallink and Silja line cruises for over three decades. The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>
<p>Costa Cruises brand currently operates six casino ships and 8 vessels without gaming facilities. All sail under the Italian flag in the waters of the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, and South America. None of the casino spaces are huge by international standards but all are well appointed and offer tables and slots. The <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-mediterranea-2160.html">Mediterranea</a>, sailing out of Savona in Italy, offers the most slots with over 140 machines, while the <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-atlantica-2156.html">Atlantica</a>, departing from Tianjin, China offers the most table games with a count of 21.</p>
<p>The table game selection varies by ship but you will usually find blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as craps on some vessels.</p>
<p>All of the vessels offer fine dining, recreation, entertainment, shopping, sport, and wellness facilities including spas. Some of the ships without casino feature 4D Cinema as part of the kids' package of family fun.</p>
<p>Some of the amenities found on Costa Cruises Fortuna, sailing out of Port Rashid, Dubai, United Arab Emirates include a theater, library, art gallery, cognac bar and a cigar bar. Dining ranges from casual to fine dining on all vessels with 7-Michelin starred chef's tending to your needs on some.</p>
<p>For those who smoke and those who prefer not to be exposed, all cabins and public rooms are smoke-free. There are designated spaces on open decks for smokers and you can smoke on your private cabin balcony - and of course, in the Cigar Bar. e-cigarettes are in your cabin as well.</p>
<p>neoClassica and neoRomantica sail out of Mumbai, India and Port Louis, Mauritius respectively and offer a good variety of gaming.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_882" style="display:none"><p>Crystal Cruises is an American luxury liner with two casino outfitted ships as of 2018. Formerly owned and operated by Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) with Caesars Casinos onboard, the line was sold to <a href="owners/genting-hong-kong.html">Genting Hong Kong</a> in 2015. The casinos were rebranded as Resorts World casinos after Genting's other land-based casino brand.</p>

<p><strong>Queen Mary 2</strong> offers Roulette, Blackjack, Three card poker, and Heads up Texas Hold'em - a house-banked casino game played against the dealer - as well as about 100 slot machines. There are 9 gaming tables in total aboard QM2. As mention, the casino opens about 45 minutes after leaving port. Once out to sea, slots machines are available for play beginning at 10am. Tables are open from 11am until 5pm, and then again from 7:30pm until close. Closing time is at the discretion of the casino manager.</p>
<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth</strong> offers about 45 slot machines and 5 gaming tables. Available table games include Roulette, Blackjack, Three Card Poker, and Fun 21.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself:</p>
<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Seabourn is a luxury cruise liner...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect to pay top price for your cruise</li>
<li>Formal nights are optional so you could save on wardrobe costs</li>
<li>Prices are all-inclusive so your drinks are paid for</li>
<li>Gourmands will especially appreciate Restaurant 2</li>

The company is headquartered in <a href="monaco.html">Monaco</a> and owned in the majority (67%) by <a href="owners/royal-caribbean-cruises.html">Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd</a>.</p>
<p>The company's current fleet comprises nine vessels. The largest and newest ship is Silver Muse at 40,700 gross tons and capacity for nearly 600 passengers. Six of the ships are over sixteen tons and three are clippers in the company's Expedition fleet.</p>

<p>There are no gaming facilities on the smaller expedition class ships.</p>
<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>
<p>You can click the following link to view the <a href="https://www.silversea.com/ships/silver-shadow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">casino aboard Silver Shadow</a>.</p>
<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package. If unsure of local laws, please wait until you are 12 miles out to sea before you <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/">gambling online</a>.</p>

<p>If you've ever been on a gambling ship, as opposed to a luxury cruise liner with a casino...</p>
<p><strong>You might ask:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I thought gambling was a monopoly in Florida. How do they do it?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, most of the <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots">slots</a> and table games are in the <a href="florida.html">Seminole Tribe's Hard Rock casinos</a>. You can find poker and a few <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">other games like poker</a> at <a href="florida.html">Florida racetracks</a> and jai alai frontons.</p>
<p>Once the ship enters international waters, Florida gambling laws no longer apply.</p>
<p>The 3-mile journey usually takes about 30 minutes - then the games are on!</p>

<p>This is a gambling ship <br />You'll be out to sea for 5-6 hours <br />People smoke outside, so you might smell it</p>
<p><strong>You might say:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Okay, I get it. But what about the casino... is it a real casino?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>
<p>It's a real casino alright. There are over 600 slots so there should always be some open. On a busy cruise, they'll open up to 100 gaming tables. That puts it on par with most Downtown Las Vegas properties and quite a few on the Strip.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you can play...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slots</li>
<li>Blackjack $5-$500 - dealer stands all 17's - BJ pays 3:2</li>

<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>Visit Windstar Cruises to find a cruise, plan your journey, look for specials, or<a href="https://www.windstarcruises.com/yachts/" target="_blank"> dream about the yachts</a>!</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_540" style="display:none"><p>Seafaring gamblers in the Nordic region, especially the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, have been enjoying the gambling services of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paf</a> on Tallink and Silja line cruises for over three decades. The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>
<p>Costa Cruises brand currently operates six casino ships and 8 vessels without gaming facilities.

<p>You might be wondering:</p>
<p><strong>"How many of the oceangoing vessels have casinos?"</strong></p>
<p>Good news for seafaring gamblers! Royal Caribbean has outfitted their entire current fleet with onboard casinos! Some are a little bigger than others, and some have more game variety, but they all have lots of slots and plenty of table game action.</p>
<p>Sailing out of England? Consider booking the <a href="casino/royal-caribbean-international-navigator-of-the-seas-2222.html">Navigator of the Seas</a>;</p>
<p>From Barcelona, Vision;</p>
<p>Shanghai? <a href="casino/royal-caribbean-quantum-of-the-seas.html">Quantum of the Seas</a>;</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Voyager.</p>
<p>Most of the other cruises depart from the <a href="united-states.html">U.S</a>. and <a href="puerto-rico.html">Puerto Rico</a>.</p>
<p>All of the casinos offer <strong>thousands of square feet of Vegas-style action</strong> under the lights with video slots, video poker, table games, and tournaments.</p>
<p>Some of the table games you can expect to find on your Royal Caribbean cruise are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/1-deck/" target="_blank">Single Deck Blackjack</a></li>
<li>Roulette</li>
<li>Baccarat</li>

<li>Blackjack with Side Bets like Lucky Ladies</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Walking up to a high stakes blackjack table and sitting down with a stack of chips in front of you can seem intimidating to casual players and those who may need to brush up a little on their game. Royal Caribbean has you covered! During the day, your hosts will be glad to teach you the ins and outs of any game from roulette to baccarat. Once you get your "sea legs" for the game you can join a tournament where everyone has a chance to progress to the grand finale without risking stacks of your hard earned cash along the way.</p>
<p>If you want to win big prizes with more help from Lady Luck than your own gambling experience, try a Slot Tournament. Simply go to the Casino Cash Desk when the casino is open to enroll in a qualifying tournament. Even <strong>Beginner's Luck</strong> can help you grab a chunk of the $50,000 prize pool!</p>
<p><strong>This might seem crazy:</strong></p>
<p>Poker players can qualify for the Royal Poker Tournament throughout the year. Winners are eligible for entry into the finals with a chance to win part of the <strong>$100,000 Royal Poker Prize Pool!</strong> Don't forget, you may be eligible for a free cruise vacation for two along the way.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself:</p>
<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Seabourn is a luxury cruise liner...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect to pay top price for your cruise</li>
<li>Formal nights are optional so you could save on wardrobe costs</li>
<li>Prices are all-inclusive so your drinks are paid for</li>
<li>Gourmands will especially appreciate Restaurant 2</li>
</ul>

<p>The company's current fleet comprises nine vessels. The largest and newest ship is Silver Muse at 40,700 gross tons and capacity for nearly 600 passengers. Six of the ships are over sixteen tons and three are clippers in the company's Expedition fleet.</p>

<p>There are no gaming facilities on the smaller expedition class ships.</p>
<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>
<p>You can click the following link to view the <a href="https://www.silversea.com/ships/silver-shadow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">casino aboard Silver Shadow</a>.</p>
<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package. If unsure of local laws, please wait until you are 12 miles out to sea before you <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/">gambling online</a>.</p>

<p><strong>You might ask:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I thought gambling was a monopoly in Florida. How do they do it?"</em></p>

<p>Yes, most of the <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots">slots</a> and table games are in the <a href="florida.html">Seminole Tribe's Hard Rock casinos</a>. You can find poker and a few <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">other games like poker</a> at <a href="florida.html">Florida racetracks</a> and jai alai frontons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"Okay, I get it. But what about the casino... is it a real casino?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>
<p>It's a real casino alright. There are over 600 slots so there should always be some open. On a busy cruise, they'll open up to 100 gaming tables. That puts it on par with most Downtown Las Vegas properties and quite a few on the Strip.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you can play...</strong></p>

The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck.

<p>The first thing readers here probably want to know is whether there's a casino on board. Yes! All four ships offer gambling when out to sea. But there's a lot more...</p>
<p>All-Inclusive Value (including meals, taxes, and alcohol drinks) <br />40 Years Experience <br />Mixture of Midsized &amp; Larger Ships <br />Spanish Crews - European Culture <br />Family Friendly <br />Relaxed Atmosphere <br />Available in the UK Through Fred.\ Holidays</p>
<p>Whether you choose a casino cruise destination in the Baltics, Caribbean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, Norway and the Fjords, or South America, Pullmantur Cruises offers a variety of cruise and gambling experiences to fit your vacation lifestyle.</p>
<p>The casino onboard MV Horizon, one of the smaller ships, offers computerized gaming and live tables. Casino Monte Carlo on the MV Zenith has live gaming tables and computerized slots to try your luck. The casinos on the larger <a href="casino/pullman-cruises-monarch.html">MS Monarch</a> and MS Sovereign are branded as Casino del Mar and offer even more gaming opportunities with roulette and <a href="https://latestcasinobonuses.com/blackjack" target="_blank">blackjack</a> to complement the slots action. Monarch's casino also has bingo, poker games, and live sports betting.</p>
<p>Wait...</p>
<p><strong> There's got to be more, right..?</strong></p>
<p>One motto you will hear from Pullmantur Cruises is that <strong>"The Journey is the Destination."</strong> This is enough to tell us that life onboard is about more than excitement and entertainment, you'll also find public spaces such as an atrium on a larger ship, conference rooms and internet centers, and much more.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that the casinos are not open 24 hours a day and gaming will not be available unless you are in international waters.

<p><strong>"How many of the oceangoing vessels have casinos?"</strong></p>
<p>Good news for seafaring gamblers! Royal Caribbean has outfitted their entire current fleet with onboard casinos! Some are a little bigger than others, and some have more game variety, but they all have lots of slots and plenty of table game action.</p>

<p>All of the casinos offer <strong>thousands of square feet of Vegas-style action</strong> under the lights with video slots, video poker, table games, and tournaments.</p>
<p>Some of the table games you can expect to find on your Royal Caribbean cruise are:</p>

Royal Caribbean has you covered! During the day, your hosts will be glad to teach you the ins and outs of any game from roulette to baccarat.

<p><strong>This might seem crazy:</strong></p>

<p>You might be asking yourself:</p>
<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Seabourn is a luxury cruise liner...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect to pay top price for your cruise</li>
<li>Formal nights are optional so you could save on wardrobe costs</li>
<li>Prices are all-inclusive so your drinks are paid for</li>
<li>Gourmands will especially appreciate Restaurant 2</li>

<p>The company's current fleet comprises nine vessels. The largest and newest ship is Silver Muse at 40,700 gross tons and capacity for nearly 600 passengers. Six of the ships are over sixteen tons and three are clippers in the company's Expedition fleet.</p>

<p>There are no gaming facilities on the smaller expedition class ships.</p>
<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>
<p>You can click the following link to view the <a href="https://www.silversea.com/ships/silver-shadow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">casino aboard Silver Shadow</a>.</p>
<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package. If unsure of local laws, please wait until you are 12 miles out to sea before you <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/">gambling online</a>.</p>

<p><em>"I thought gambling was a monopoly in Florida. How do they do it?"</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>

The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels.

Baby boomers may recall <a href="casino/princess-cruises-island-princess-2024.html">Island Princess</a> and <a href="casino/princess-cruises-pacific-princess-2025.html">Pacific Princess</a> as the ships featured in the 1970s television series, The Love Boat.</p>
<p>P&amp;O spun off its passenger division in 2000, and it merged with <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Carnival</a> in 2003. The combined company then featured 11 different brands of cruise ship companies. Princess, Carnival, and Holland America stopped requisitioning new ships during the 2008 economic downturn but added three new 3,600 passenger ships beginning with Royal Princess in 2013 and Regal Princess which entered service in 2014. A third Fincantieri-built ship, Majestic Princess launched in 2017.</p>
<p>The entire current fleet flies the flag of Bermuda except for Royal, Majestic, Golden, Diamond, and Sapphire Princess which ships call the UK home. Three additional Bermuda-flagged Royal Class vessels are slated for launch in 2019, 2020, and 2022.</p>
<p>Departure points for Princess Cruises include <a href="british-columbia/vancouver.html">Vancouver, Canada</a>, Brisbane, Rozelle, and Melbourne in Australia; Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in the US, as well as <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Rome, Italy, and Piraeus in Greece.</p>
<p>USA Today has awarded Princess the accolade of "Best cruise lines for Gamblers" and slots fans are frequently offered high return tournaments like the $200,000 Monopoly Cruise for Cash tournament. There are tournaments on every cruise so blackjack players and slots spinners have a chance to compete against their shipmates for cash prizes.</p>
<p>Games vary from ship to ship but most voyagers will find traditional, video, and progressive jackpot slot machines as well as video poker. Table games can include heads-up Texas Hold ‘Em poker, and casino games like Caribbean Stud Poker, Three Card Poker and Let it Ride. Blackjack, dice, roulette, and other table games are available on most ships and you can even play bingo with ticket packages ranging from $10 to $30.</p>
<p>A fairly new "class" of ships was introduced in 2017, known as the Ocean Medallion Class. These are 'the internet of things' ships with omnichannel connectivity to guests accounts from a medallion wristband. On ships appointed with the amenity, guests have access to the PlayOcean Casino and PlayOcean Everywhere so they can play real money games anywhere on the ship.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_874" style="display:none"><p>Pullmantur Cruises is the largest cruise line based in <a href="spain.html">Spain</a>.

<p>You might ask:</p>
<p><strong>"What's so great about a Pullmantur Cruise?"</strong></p>
<p>The first thing readers here probably want to know is whether there's a casino on board. Yes! All four ships offer gambling when out to sea. But there's a lot more...</p>

<p>All of the casinos offer <strong>thousands of square feet of Vegas-style action</strong> under the lights with video slots, video poker, table games, and tournaments.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself:</p>
<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Seabourn is a luxury cruise liner...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect to pay top price for your cruise</li>
<li>Formal nights are optional so you could save on wardrobe costs</li>
<li>Prices are all-inclusive so your drinks are paid for</li>
<li>Gourmands will especially appreciate Restaurant 2</li>

<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>
<p>You can click the following link to view the <a href="https://www.silversea.com/ships/silver-shadow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">casino aboard Silver Shadow</a>.</p>
<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package. If unsure of local laws, please wait until you are 12 miles out to sea before you <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/">gambling online</a>.</p>

The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels.

For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>

<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>

<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request.

<p>The casinos are rather small in relation to the overall ship size on some vessels, mainly due to the extended times at sea. However, they are also a favorite attraction of many oceanfarers. The gambling spaces are well designed and stylish and offer table limits for all levels of players. The gaming machines include reel and video slots and video poker machines.</p>
<p>Key card wagering makes the slots cashless. Casino credit is available to qualified guests and should be arranged one-month prior to departure. The minimum credit line is $10,000 and a personal check is required when you board the vessel in order to activate a credit line. All gaming is in USD and Euros can be exchanged on board.</p>
<p>All play is tracked and rewarded through the Casinos at Sea rewards program which has 5 tiers. Points can be transfered from ship to ship and slot players can redeem rewards at any time onscreen while playing any game.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_872" style="display:none"><p>P&amp;O Cruises is the oldest cruise line in the world. The original company was founded in 1837 and the first passenger cruises from Southampton were offered in 1844. A series of de-mergers and mergers beginning in 2000 culminated in a merger with Carnival Corporation in 2003. The company operates seven cruise ships including Britannia which launched in early 2015. Two more large vessels are planned for launch in 2020 and 2020. All ships offer casino gaming once entering international waters.</p>
<p>Table games, slot machines, bingo, scratch cards, and video horse racing are all offered.</p>
<p>Roulette, blackjack, and three card poker are offered on all ships. Three of the casinos also offer Fun 21. If you don't see the game when aboard the <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-arcadia.html">Arcadia</a> and there is an empty blackjack table, ask your host to flip the table as the Fun 21 felt is just underneath. Purchase your chips from the dealer with cash or your cruise card. All winnings are cashed out onto your cruise card.</p>
<p>Slot machines all operate on a coinless system. To play, simply insert your cruise card or cash notes.</p>
<p>Bingo offers five cash prizes each full day out to sea. There's also a jackpot that grows with nearly every game and must be won by the conclusion of the cruise.</p>
<p>Scratch cards have prizes up to &pound;20,000 and can be purchased at the casino desk. Video horse racing is presented on big screens.</p>
<p>Arcadia features 4 tables and a variety of slots on the F deck. <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-aurora-1709.html">Aurora's casino</a> is located on the Prom deck and features 4 tables and slots. Head to the F deck on Azura to find five tables offering three card poker, blackjack, roulette x2, and Fun 21.</p>
<p>The casino on Britannia is deck 6 with 2 tables each offering blackjack, roulette, and three card poker. <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-oceana-1710.html">Oceana</a> has five tables on D deck - Oriana offers 23 tables on the Prom deck, and there are five tables on F deck of Ventura.</p>
<p>On sea days slots are open on all ships from 10 am until late with tables opening at noon. On port days, gaming doesn't start until the ship reaches international waters, which usually takes about 45 minutes. Opening times can vary by jurisdiction, but the demarcation point is usually 12 miles outside of port limits.</p>
<p>Be sure to cash in your chips before leaving the ship. If you happen to forget, you can bring them along for your next voyage but may meet delays while the chips are authenticated.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_877" style="display:none"><p>Princess Cruises launched their first Mexican Riviera cruise in 1965 but didn't become a household name known to people who vacation at sea until about a decade later when the company was acquired by P&amp;O, who at the time was the world's largest oceanic shipper with more 300 vessels in operation. Baby boomers may recall <a href="casino/princess-cruises-island-princess-2024.html">Island Princess</a> and <a href="casino/princess-cruises-pacific-princess-2025.html">Pacific Princess</a> as the ships featured in the 1970s television series, The Love Boat.</p>
<p>P&amp;O spun off its passenger division in 2000, and it merged with <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Carnival</a> in 2003. The combined company then featured 11 different brands of cruise ship companies. Princess, Carnival, and Holland America stopped requisitioning new ships during the 2008 economic downturn but added three new 3,600 passenger ships beginning with Royal Princess in 2013 and Regal Princess which entered service in 2014. A third Fincantieri-built ship, Majestic Princess launched in 2017.</p>
<p>The entire current fleet flies the flag of Bermuda except for Royal, Majestic, Golden, Diamond, and Sapphire Princess which ships call the UK home. Three additional Bermuda-flagged Royal Class vessels are slated for launch in 2019, 2020, and 2022.</p>
<p>Departure points for Princess Cruises include <a href="british-columbia/vancouver.html">Vancouver, Canada</a>, Brisbane, Rozelle, and Melbourne in Australia; Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in the US, as well as <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Rome, Italy, and Piraeus in Greece.</p>
<p>USA Today has awarded Princess the accolade of "Best cruise lines for Gamblers" and slots fans are frequently offered high return tournaments like the $200,000 Monopoly Cruise for Cash tournament. There are tournaments on every cruise so blackjack players and slots spinners have a chance to compete against their shipmates for cash prizes.</p>
<p>Games vary from ship to ship but most voyagers will find traditional, video, and progressive jackpot slot machines as well as video poker. Table games can include heads-up Texas Hold ‘Em poker, and casino games like Caribbean Stud Poker, Three Card Poker and Let it Ride. Blackjack, dice, roulette, and other table games are available on most ships and you can even play bingo with ticket packages ranging from $10 to $30.</p>
<p>A fairly new "class" of ships was introduced in 2017, known as the Ocean Medallion Class. These are 'the internet of things' ships with omnichannel connectivity to guests accounts from a medallion wristband. On ships appointed with the amenity, guests have access to the PlayOcean Casino and PlayOcean Everywhere so they can play real money games anywhere on the ship.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_874" style="display:none"><p>Pullmantur Cruises is the largest cruise line based in <a href="spain.html">Spain</a>.

<p>You might ask:</p>
<p><strong>"What's so great about a Pullmantur Cruise?"</strong></p>
<p>The first thing readers here probably want to know is whether there's a casino on board. Yes! All four ships offer gambling when out to sea. But there's a lot more...</p>

<p>All of the casinos offer <strong>thousands of square feet of Vegas-style action</strong> under the lights with video slots, video poker, table games, and tournaments.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself:</p>
<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>

<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>

<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package. If unsure of local laws, please wait until you are 12 miles out to sea before you <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/">gambling online</a>.</p>

<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>Visit Windstar Cruises to find a cruise, plan your journey, look for specials, or<a href="https://www.windstarcruises.com/yachts/" target="_blank"> dream about the yachts</a>!</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_540" style="display:none"><p>Seafaring gamblers in the Nordic region, especially the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, have been enjoying the gambling services of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paf</a> on Tallink and Silja line cruises for over three decades. The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>

All sail under the Italian flag in the waters of the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, and South America. None of the casino spaces are huge by international standards but all are well appointed and offer tables and slots. The <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-mediterranea-2160.html">Mediterranea</a>, sailing out of Savona in Italy, offers the most slots with over 140 machines, while the <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-atlantica-2156.html">Atlantica</a>, departing from Tianjin, China offers the most table games with a count of 21.</p>
<p>The table game selection varies by ship but you will usually find blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as craps on some vessels.</p>
<p>All of the vessels offer fine dining, recreation, entertainment, shopping, sport, and wellness facilities including spas. Some of the ships without casino feature 4D Cinema as part of the kids' package of family fun.</p>
<p>Some of the amenities found on Costa Cruises Fortuna, sailing out of Port Rashid, Dubai, United Arab Emirates include a theater, library, art gallery, cognac bar and a cigar bar.

Formerly owned and operated by Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) with Caesars Casinos onboard, the line was sold to <a href="owners/genting-hong-kong.html">Genting Hong Kong</a> in 2015.

Starting out with Britain's first transatlantic steamship mail contract, there are now three vessels in operation offering Northern European, Mediterranean, Transatlantic, Caribbean, and World Cruises.</p>
<p>The fleet currently consists of the ocean liner <a href="casino/queen-mary-2-2206.html">Queen Mary 2</a>, and cruise ships <a href="casino/cunard-line-queen-elizabeth-2-2165.html">Queen Elizabeth</a> and <a href="casino/cunard-cruises-queen-victoria.html">Queen Victoria</a>.

All ships except Epic, Breakaway, and Getaway offer a Wheel of Madness side bet on the game. The optional bet can range from $1 to $10. When a player with a stake on the wheel is dealt a natural Blackjack they'll get a spin on the wheel to determine their side bet multiplier. The top prize is $5,000.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy sailing on small city-size ships, Norwegian has added a third vessel to its Breakaway-Plus series with the launch of the 168,028-ton, 1,082-foot-long,  20-deck, 4,004 passenger <a href="casino/norwegian-cruise-lines-norwegian-bliss.html">Norwegian Bliss</a> in 2018. She joins Escape and Joy in the class. Those ships launched in 2015 and 2017, respectively.</p>
<p>The cruise line is very popular and consistently adds to its fleet. There are 7 new additions to the fleet slated for release between 2019 and 2027. The five most recent debuts include Norwegian Bliss (2018), Joy (2017) Escape (2015), Getaway (2014), and Breakaway (2013).</p>
<p>So far, Norwegian Bliss is the most innovative casino ship in the fleet with over 300 pokies (slots and video poker) and 25 gaming tables.</p>
<p>Across the fleet, poker players register well ahead of time for the Norwegian Cruise Line Poker Challenge (NCLPC). The field is expected to surpass 400 participants soon.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_878" style="display:none"><p>Oceania Cruises launched their first ship in 2002 and currently has a fleet of six ships. All of them offer gambling facilities. Founded by a team of cruise industry veterans, the company was acquired by <a href="owners/norwegian-cruise-line.html">Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, LTD</a> in 2014 along with a sister company, <a href="owners/regent-seven-seas-cruises.html">Regent Seven Seas Cruises</a>. Norwegian (NCL) is headquartered in Florida. All of Oceania's vessels fly the flag of the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>There are 4 ships in the Regatta class, all were built in 1998, 1999, or 2000. The <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-regatta-2197.html">MS Regatta</a> was launched in 2003 and last refurbished in 2014. The most recent launch in the class was the 30,277 ton, 343 cabin, <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-serina.html">MS Sirena</a>. The former Ocean Princess underwent a $40 million refurbishment in France and launched in 2016.</p>
<p>Two brand new Oceania class ships were commissioned from Italian builder Fincantieri and are the first two new builds for the company. <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-marina.html">MS Marina</a>, at 66,084 tons can hold 1,250 passengers and 580 of the 625 suites and cabins have private verandas. Marina launched in 2011. Her sister ship, which launched in 2012, is the <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-riviera.html">MS Riviera</a>.</p>
<p>Two-week-long cruises are the norm for Oceania but they are most well known for much longer tours such as "Around the World in 180 Days" voyages and others lasting up to 195 days. The 6-month world cruises began in 2015. Bookings for the 180-Day World Cruises are taken up to two years in advance.</p>
<p>The casinos are rather small in relation to the overall ship size on some vessels, mainly due to the extended times at sea. However, they are also a favorite attraction of many oceanfarers. The gambling spaces are well designed and stylish and offer table limits for all levels of players. The gaming machines include reel and video slots and video poker machines.</p>
<p>Key card wagering makes the slots cashless. Casino credit is available to qualified guests and should be arranged one-month prior to departure. The minimum credit line is $10,000 and a personal check is required when you board the vessel in order to activate a credit line. All gaming is in USD and Euros can be exchanged on board.</p>
<p>All play is tracked and rewarded through the Casinos at Sea rewards program which has 5 tiers. Points can be transfered from ship to ship and slot players can redeem rewards at any time onscreen while playing any game.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_872" style="display:none"><p>P&amp;O Cruises is the oldest cruise line in the world. The original company was founded in 1837 and the first passenger cruises from Southampton were offered in 1844. A series of de-mergers and mergers beginning in 2000 culminated in a merger with Carnival Corporation in 2003. The company operates seven cruise ships including Britannia which launched in early 2015. Two more large vessels are planned for launch in 2020 and 2020. All ships offer casino gaming once entering international waters.</p>
<p>Table games, slot machines, bingo, scratch cards, and video horse racing are all offered.</p>
<p>Roulette, blackjack, and three card poker are offered on all ships. Three of the casinos also offer Fun 21. If you don't see the game when aboard the <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-arcadia.html">Arcadia</a> and there is an empty blackjack table, ask your host to flip the table as the Fun 21 felt is just underneath. Purchase your chips from the dealer with cash or your cruise card. All winnings are cashed out onto your cruise card.</p>
<p>Slot machines all operate on a coinless system. To play, simply insert your cruise card or cash notes.</p>
<p>Bingo offers five cash prizes each full day out to sea. There's also a jackpot that grows with nearly every game and must be won by the conclusion of the cruise.</p>
<p>Scratch cards have prizes up to &pound;20,000 and can be purchased at the casino desk. Video horse racing is presented on big screens.</p>
<p>Arcadia features 4 tables and a variety of slots on the F deck. <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-aurora-1709.html">Aurora's casino</a> is located on the Prom deck and features 4 tables and slots. Head to the F deck on Azura to find five tables offering three card poker, blackjack, roulette x2, and Fun 21.</p>
<p>The casino on Britannia is deck 6 with 2 tables each offering blackjack, roulette, and three card poker. <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-oceana-1710.html">Oceana</a> has five tables on D deck - Oriana offers 23 tables on the Prom deck, and there are five tables on F deck of Ventura.</p>
<p>On sea days slots are open on all ships from 10 am until late with tables opening at noon. On port days, gaming doesn't start until the ship reaches international waters, which usually takes about 45 minutes. Opening times can vary by jurisdiction, but the demarcation point is usually 12 miles outside of port limits.</p>
<p>Be sure to cash in your chips before leaving the ship. If you happen to forget, you can bring them along for your next voyage but may meet delays while the chips are authenticated.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_877" style="display:none"><p>Princess Cruises launched their first Mexican Riviera cruise in 1965 but didn't become a household name known to people who vacation at sea until about a decade later when the company was acquired by P&amp;O, who at the time was the world's largest oceanic shipper with more 300 vessels in operation. Baby boomers may recall <a href="casino/princess-cruises-island-princess-2024.html">Island Princess</a> and <a href="casino/princess-cruises-pacific-princess-2025.html">Pacific Princess</a> as the ships featured in the 1970s television series, The Love Boat.</p>
<p>P&amp;O spun off its passenger division in 2000, and it merged with <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Carnival</a> in 2003. The combined company then featured 11 different brands of cruise ship companies. Princess, Carnival, and Holland America stopped requisitioning new ships during the 2008 economic downturn but added three new 3,600 passenger ships beginning with Royal Princess in 2013 and Regal Princess which entered service in 2014. A third Fincantieri-built ship, Majestic Princess launched in 2017.</p>
<p>The entire current fleet flies the flag of Bermuda except for Royal, Majestic, Golden, Diamond, and Sapphire Princess which ships call the UK home. Three additional Bermuda-flagged Royal Class vessels are slated for launch in 2019, 2020, and 2022.</p>
<p>Departure points for Princess Cruises include <a href="british-columbia/vancouver.html">Vancouver, Canada</a>, Brisbane, Rozelle, and Melbourne in Australia; Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in the US, as well as <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Rome, Italy, and Piraeus in Greece.</p>
<p>USA Today has awarded Princess the accolade of "Best cruise lines for Gamblers" and slots fans are frequently offered high return tournaments like the $200,000 Monopoly Cruise for Cash tournament. There are tournaments on every cruise so blackjack players and slots spinners have a chance to compete against their shipmates for cash prizes.</p>
<p>Games vary from ship to ship but most voyagers will find traditional, video, and progressive jackpot slot machines as well as video poker. Table games can include heads-up Texas Hold ‘Em poker, and casino games like Caribbean Stud Poker, Three Card Poker and Let it Ride. Blackjack, dice, roulette, and other table games are available on most ships and you can even play bingo with ticket packages ranging from $10 to $30.</p>
<p>A fairly new "class" of ships was introduced in 2017, known as the Ocean Medallion Class. These are 'the internet of things' ships with omnichannel connectivity to guests accounts from a medallion wristband. On ships appointed with the amenity, guests have access to the PlayOcean Casino and PlayOcean Everywhere so they can play real money games anywhere on the ship.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_874" style="display:none"><p>Pullmantur Cruises is the largest cruise line based in <a href="spain.html">Spain</a>.

<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>

<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>

<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>

<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>Visit Windstar Cruises to find a cruise, plan your journey, look for specials, or<a href="https://www.windstarcruises.com/yachts/" target="_blank"> dream about the yachts</a>!</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_540" style="display:none"><p>Seafaring gamblers in the Nordic region, especially the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, have been enjoying the gambling services of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paf</a> on Tallink and Silja line cruises for over three decades. The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>
<p>Costa Cruises brand currently operates six casino ships and 8 vessels without gaming facilities. All sail under the Italian flag in the waters of the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, and South America. None of the casino spaces are huge by international standards but all are well appointed and offer tables and slots. The <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-mediterranea-2160.html">Mediterranea</a>, sailing out of Savona in Italy, offers the most slots with over 140 machines, while the <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-atlantica-2156.html">Atlantica</a>, departing from Tianjin, China offers the most table games with a count of 21.</p>
<p>The table game selection varies by ship but you will usually find blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as craps on some vessels.</p>
<p>All of the vessels offer fine dining, recreation, entertainment, shopping, sport, and wellness facilities including spas. Some of the ships without casino feature 4D Cinema as part of the kids' package of family fun.</p>
<p>Some of the amenities found on Costa Cruises Fortuna, sailing out of Port Rashid, Dubai, United Arab Emirates include a theater, library, art gallery, cognac bar and a cigar bar. Dining ranges from casual to fine dining on all vessels with 7-Michelin starred chef's tending to your needs on some.</p>

<p>neoClassica and neoRomantica sail out of Mumbai, India and Port Louis, Mauritius respectively and offer a good variety of gaming.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_882" style="display:none"><p>Crystal Cruises is an American luxury liner with two casino outfitted ships as of 2018. Formerly owned and operated by Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) with Caesars Casinos onboard, the line was sold to <a href="owners/genting-hong-kong.html">Genting Hong Kong</a> in 2015.

Starting out with Britain's first transatlantic steamship mail contract, there are now three vessels in operation offering Northern European, Mediterranean, Transatlantic, Caribbean, and World Cruises.</p>
<p>The fleet currently consists of the ocean liner <a href="casino/queen-mary-2-2206.html">Queen Mary 2</a>, and cruise ships <a href="casino/cunard-line-queen-elizabeth-2-2165.html">Queen Elizabeth</a> and <a href="casino/cunard-cruises-queen-victoria.html">Queen Victoria</a>. A 4th vessel is slated for operation n 2022. There is a casino on board each Cunard ship. However, not all cruises offer gambling as the Empire Casinos do not open during voyages without foreign ports of call on the itinerary.

All of them offer gambling facilities. Founded by a team of cruise industry veterans, the company was acquired by <a href="owners/norwegian-cruise-line.html">Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, LTD</a> in 2014 along with a sister company, <a href="owners/regent-seven-seas-cruises.html">Regent Seven Seas Cruises</a>. Norwegian (NCL) is headquartered in Florida. All of Oceania's vessels fly the flag of the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>There are 4 ships in the Regatta class, all were built in 1998, 1999, or 2000. The <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-regatta-2197.html">MS Regatta</a> was launched in 2003 and last refurbished in 2014. The most recent launch in the class was the 30,277 ton, 343 cabin, <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-serina.html">MS Sirena</a>. The former Ocean Princess underwent a $40 million refurbishment in France and launched in 2016.</p>
<p>Two brand new Oceania class ships were commissioned from Italian builder Fincantieri and are the first two new builds for the company. <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-marina.html">MS Marina</a>, at 66,084 tons can hold 1,250 passengers and 580 of the 625 suites and cabins have private verandas. Marina launched in 2011. Her sister ship, which launched in 2012, is the <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-riviera.html">MS Riviera</a>.</p>
<p>Two-week-long cruises are the norm for Oceania but they are most well known for much longer tours such as "Around the World in 180 Days" voyages and others lasting up to 195 days. The 6-month world cruises began in 2015. Bookings for the 180-Day World Cruises are taken up to two years in advance.</p>
<p>The casinos are rather small in relation to the overall ship size on some vessels, mainly due to the extended times at sea. However, they are also a favorite attraction of many oceanfarers. The gambling spaces are well designed and stylish and offer table limits for all levels of players. The gaming machines include reel and video slots and video poker machines.</p>
<p>Key card wagering makes the slots cashless. Casino credit is available to qualified guests and should be arranged one-month prior to departure. The minimum credit line is $10,000 and a personal check is required when you board the vessel in order to activate a credit line. All gaming is in USD and Euros can be exchanged on board.</p>
<p>All play is tracked and rewarded through the Casinos at Sea rewards program which has 5 tiers. Points can be transfered from ship to ship and slot players can redeem rewards at any time onscreen while playing any game.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_872" style="display:none"><p>P&amp;O Cruises is the oldest cruise line in the world. The original company was founded in 1837 and the first passenger cruises from Southampton were offered in 1844. A series of de-mergers and mergers beginning in 2000 culminated in a merger with Carnival Corporation in 2003. The company operates seven cruise ships including Britannia which launched in early 2015. Two more large vessels are planned for launch in 2020 and 2020. All ships offer casino gaming once entering international waters.</p>
<p>Table games, slot machines, bingo, scratch cards, and video horse racing are all offered.</p>
<p>Roulette, blackjack, and three card poker are offered on all ships. Three of the casinos also offer Fun 21. If you don't see the game when aboard the <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-arcadia.html">Arcadia</a> and there is an empty blackjack table, ask your host to flip the table as the Fun 21 felt is just underneath. Purchase your chips from the dealer with cash or your cruise card. All winnings are cashed out onto your cruise card.</p>
<p>Slot machines all operate on a coinless system. To play, simply insert your cruise card or cash notes.</p>
<p>Bingo offers five cash prizes each full day out to sea. There's also a jackpot that grows with nearly every game and must be won by the conclusion of the cruise.</p>
<p>Scratch cards have prizes up to &pound;20,000 and can be purchased at the casino desk. Video horse racing is presented on big screens.</p>
<p>Arcadia features 4 tables and a variety of slots on the F deck. <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-aurora-1709.html">Aurora's casino</a> is located on the Prom deck and features 4 tables and slots. Head to the F deck on Azura to find five tables offering three card poker, blackjack, roulette x2, and Fun 21.</p>

<p>On sea days slots are open on all ships from 10 am until late with tables opening at noon. On port days, gaming doesn't start until the ship reaches international waters, which usually takes about 45 minutes. Opening times can vary by jurisdiction, but the demarcation point is usually 12 miles outside of port limits.</p>
<p>Be sure to cash in your chips before leaving the ship. If you happen to forget, you can bring them along for your next voyage but may meet delays while the chips are authenticated.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_877" style="display:none"><p>Princess Cruises launched their first Mexican Riviera cruise in 1965 but didn't become a household name known to people who vacation at sea until about a decade later when the company was acquired by P&amp;O, who at the time was the world's largest oceanic shipper with more 300 vessels in operation. Baby boomers may recall <a href="casino/princess-cruises-island-princess-2024.html">Island Princess</a> and <a href="casino/princess-cruises-pacific-princess-2025.html">Pacific Princess</a> as the ships featured in the 1970s television series, The Love Boat.</p>
<p>P&amp;O spun off its passenger division in 2000, and it merged with <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Carnival</a> in 2003. The combined company then featured 11 different brands of cruise ship companies. Princess, Carnival, and Holland America stopped requisitioning new ships during the 2008 economic downturn but added three new 3,600 passenger ships beginning with Royal Princess in 2013 and Regal Princess which entered service in 2014. A third Fincantieri-built ship, Majestic Princess launched in 2017.</p>
<p>The entire current fleet flies the flag of Bermuda except for Royal, Majestic, Golden, Diamond, and Sapphire Princess which ships call the UK home. Three additional Bermuda-flagged Royal Class vessels are slated for launch in 2019, 2020, and 2022.</p>
<p>Departure points for Princess Cruises include <a href="british-columbia/vancouver.html">Vancouver, Canada</a>, Brisbane, Rozelle, and Melbourne in Australia; Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in the US, as well as <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Rome, Italy, and Piraeus in Greece.</p>
<p>USA Today has awarded Princess the accolade of "Best cruise lines for Gamblers" and slots fans are frequently offered high return tournaments like the $200,000 Monopoly Cruise for Cash tournament. There are tournaments on every cruise so blackjack players and slots spinners have a chance to compete against their shipmates for cash prizes.</p>
<p>Games vary from ship to ship but most voyagers will find traditional, video, and progressive jackpot slot machines as well as video poker. Table games can include heads-up Texas Hold ‘Em poker, and casino games like Caribbean Stud Poker, Three Card Poker and Let it Ride. Blackjack, dice, roulette, and other table games are available on most ships and you can even play bingo with ticket packages ranging from $10 to $30.</p>
<p>A fairly new "class" of ships was introduced in 2017, known as the Ocean Medallion Class. These are 'the internet of things' ships with omnichannel connectivity to guests accounts from a medallion wristband. On ships appointed with the amenity, guests have access to the PlayOcean Casino and PlayOcean Everywhere so they can play real money games anywhere on the ship.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfoMobile_874" style="display:none"><p>Pullmantur Cruises is the largest cruise line based in <a href="spain.html">Spain</a>.

<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>

<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>

If you are looking for a 'cruise to nowhere' this might be your best bet. The Victory I first set sail in 1972 and was refurbished before Victory launched their casino cruise.</p>
<p>If you've ever been on a gambling ship, as opposed to a luxury cruise liner with a casino...</p>
<p><strong>You might ask:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I thought gambling was a monopoly in Florida. How do they do it?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, most of the <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots">slots</a> and table games are in the <a href="florida.html">Seminole Tribe's Hard Rock casinos</a>. You can find poker and a few <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">other games like poker</a> at <a href="florida.html">Florida racetracks</a> and jai alai frontons.</p>
<p>Once the ship enters international waters, Florida gambling laws no longer apply.</p>
<p>The 3-mile journey usually takes about 30 minutes - then the games are on!</p>
<h2>#1 Florida Casino Cruise?</h2>
<p>Judging by the reviews on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34117-d2229441-Reviews-Victory_Casino_Cruises-Cape_Canaveral_Brevard_County_Florida.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor</a>, most people are extremely satisfied with their Victory Casino Cruise experiences. Those who weren't might not have known what to expect.</p>
<p>This is a gambling ship <br />You'll be out to sea for 5-6 hours <br />People smoke outside, so you might smell it</p>
<p><strong>You might say:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Okay, I get it. But what about the casino... is it a real casino?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>
<p>It's a real casino alright. There are over 600 slots so there should always be some open. On a busy cruise, they'll open up to 100 gaming tables. That puts it on par with most Downtown Las Vegas properties and quite a few on the Strip.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you can play...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slots</li>
<li>Blackjack $5-$500 - dealer stands all 17's - BJ pays 3:2</li>
<li>Craps</li>
<li>Roulette</li>
<li>EZ Baccarat</li>
<li>Ultimate Texas Hold'em</li>

<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>Visit Windstar Cruises to find a cruise, plan your journey, look for specials, or<a href="https://www.windstarcruises.com/yachts/" target="_blank"> dream about the yachts</a>!</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_540" style="display:none"><p>Seafaring gamblers in the Nordic region, especially the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, have been enjoying the gambling services of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paf</a> on Tallink and Silja line cruises for over three decades. The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>
<p>Costa Cruises brand currently operates six casino ships and 8 vessels without gaming facilities. All sail under the Italian flag in the waters of the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, and South America. None of the casino spaces are huge by international standards but all are well appointed and offer tables and slots. The <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-mediterranea-2160.html">Mediterranea</a>, sailing out of Savona in Italy, offers the most slots with over 140 machines, while the <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-atlantica-2156.html">Atlantica</a>, departing from Tianjin, China offers the most table games with a count of 21.</p>
<p>The table game selection varies by ship but you will usually find blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as craps on some vessels.</p>
<p>All of the vessels offer fine dining, recreation, entertainment, shopping, sport, and wellness facilities including spas. Some of the ships without casino feature 4D Cinema as part of the kids' package of family fun.</p>
<p>Some of the amenities found on Costa Cruises Fortuna, sailing out of Port Rashid, Dubai, United Arab Emirates include a theater, library, art gallery, cognac bar and a cigar bar. Dining ranges from casual to fine dining on all vessels with 7-Michelin starred chef's tending to your needs on some.</p>
<p>For those who smoke and those who prefer not to be exposed, all cabins and public rooms are smoke-free. There are designated spaces on open decks for smokers and you can smoke on your private cabin balcony - and of course, in the Cigar Bar. e-cigarettes are in your cabin as well.</p>
<p>neoClassica and neoRomantica sail out of Mumbai, India and Port Louis, Mauritius respectively and offer a good variety of gaming.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_882" style="display:none"><p>Crystal Cruises is an American luxury liner with two casino outfitted ships as of 2018. Formerly owned and operated by Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) with Caesars Casinos onboard, the line was sold to <a href="owners/genting-hong-kong.html">Genting Hong Kong</a> in 2015.

Starting out with Britain's first transatlantic steamship mail contract, there are now three vessels in operation offering Northern European, Mediterranean, Transatlantic, Caribbean, and World Cruises.</p>
<p>The fleet currently consists of the ocean liner <a href="casino/queen-mary-2-2206.html">Queen Mary 2</a>, and cruise ships <a href="casino/cunard-line-queen-elizabeth-2-2165.html">Queen Elizabeth</a> and <a href="casino/cunard-cruises-queen-victoria.html">Queen Victoria</a>.

Still, a family company, five generations of Olsens have participated in the venture as well as several other sectors from shipbuilding to electronics.</p>
<p>There are five ships in the current fleet including the Brabant, Fred Olsens's first river cruise. All of the ships offer gaming opportunities, but the voyages are not usually undertaken with a primary focus on gambling. Each vessel has two gaming tables - one for blackjack and another for roulette. Many experienced passengers report that the tables are not open on every voyage. However, gambling is an advertised service and a croupier will most likely open a table upon request if it is not already in action.</p>
<p>Guests will need to be at least 18 years of age to play. Only cash (Pounds Sterling) is accepted at the tables and bets cannot be charged to your room account.</p>
<p>The Oceangoing ships are <a href="casino/fred-olsen-cruise-lines-black-watch-2898.html">Black Watch</a>,  Braemar, <a href="casino/fred-olsen-cruise-lines-boudicca.html">Boudicca</a>, and Balmoral. Onboard, passengers will find restaurants and fine dining, bars and lounges, relaxation and fitness and plenty of entertainment and fun activities which vary from sailing to sailing. Be sure to ask about the Rigid Inflatable Boats (RIBs), a great way to explore!</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_11" style="display:none"><p>The Genting Hongkong is a Corosration who owns and operate one of the leading global leisure, entertainment and other businesses.

All of them offer gambling facilities. Founded by a team of cruise industry veterans, the company was acquired by <a href="owners/norwegian-cruise-line.html">Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, LTD</a> in 2014 along with a sister company, <a href="owners/regent-seven-seas-cruises.html">Regent Seven Seas Cruises</a>. Norwegian (NCL) is headquartered in Florida. All of Oceania's vessels fly the flag of the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>There are 4 ships in the Regatta class, all were built in 1998, 1999, or 2000. The <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-regatta-2197.html">MS Regatta</a> was launched in 2003 and last refurbished in 2014. The most recent launch in the class was the 30,277 ton, 343 cabin, <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-serina.html">MS Sirena</a>. The former Ocean Princess underwent a $40 million refurbishment in France and launched in 2016.</p>
<p>Two brand new Oceania class ships were commissioned from Italian builder Fincantieri and are the first two new builds for the company. <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-marina.html">MS Marina</a>, at 66,084 tons can hold 1,250 passengers and 580 of the 625 suites and cabins have private verandas. Marina launched in 2011. Her sister ship, which launched in 2012, is the <a href="casino/oceania-cruises-riviera.html">MS Riviera</a>.</p>
<p>Two-week-long cruises are the norm for Oceania but they are most well known for much longer tours such as "Around the World in 180 Days" voyages and others lasting up to 195 days. The 6-month world cruises began in 2015. Bookings for the 180-Day World Cruises are taken up to two years in advance.</p>
<p>The casinos are rather small in relation to the overall ship size on some vessels, mainly due to the extended times at sea. However, they are also a favorite attraction of many oceanfarers. The gambling spaces are well designed and stylish and offer table limits for all levels of players. The gaming machines include reel and video slots and video poker machines.</p>
<p>Key card wagering makes the slots cashless. Casino credit is available to qualified guests and should be arranged one-month prior to departure. The minimum credit line is $10,000 and a personal check is required when you board the vessel in order to activate a credit line. All gaming is in USD and Euros can be exchanged on board.</p>

The original company was founded in 1837 and the first passenger cruises from Southampton were offered in 1844. A series of de-mergers and mergers beginning in 2000 culminated in a merger with Carnival Corporation in 2003. The company operates seven cruise ships including Britannia which launched in early 2015. Two more large vessels are planned for launch in 2020 and 2020. All ships offer casino gaming once entering international waters.</p>
<p>Table games, slot machines, bingo, scratch cards, and video horse racing are all offered.</p>
<p>Roulette, blackjack, and three card poker are offered on all ships. Three of the casinos also offer Fun 21. If you don't see the game when aboard the <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-arcadia.html">Arcadia</a> and there is an empty blackjack table, ask your host to flip the table as the Fun 21 felt is just underneath. Purchase your chips from the dealer with cash or your cruise card. All winnings are cashed out onto your cruise card.</p>
<p>Slot machines all operate on a coinless system. To play, simply insert your cruise card or cash notes.</p>
<p>Bingo offers five cash prizes each full day out to sea. There's also a jackpot that grows with nearly every game and must be won by the conclusion of the cruise.</p>
<p>Scratch cards have prizes up to &pound;20,000 and can be purchased at the casino desk. Video horse racing is presented on big screens.</p>
<p>Arcadia features 4 tables and a variety of slots on the F deck. <a href="casino/p-o-cruises-aurora-1709.html">Aurora's casino</a> is located on the Prom deck and features 4 tables and slots.

Opening times can vary by jurisdiction, but the demarcation point is usually 12 miles outside of port limits.</p>
<p>Be sure to cash in your chips before leaving the ship. If you happen to forget, you can bring them along for your next voyage but may meet delays while the chips are authenticated.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_877" style="display:none"><p>Princess Cruises launched their first Mexican Riviera cruise in 1965 but didn't become a household name known to people who vacation at sea until about a decade later when the company was acquired by P&amp;O, who at the time was the world's largest oceanic shipper with more 300 vessels in operation. Baby boomers may recall <a href="casino/princess-cruises-island-princess-2024.html">Island Princess</a> and <a href="casino/princess-cruises-pacific-princess-2025.html">Pacific Princess</a> as the ships featured in the 1970s television series, The Love Boat.</p>
<p>P&amp;O spun off its passenger division in 2000, and it merged with <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Carnival</a> in 2003. The combined company then featured 11 different brands of cruise ship companies. Princess, Carnival, and Holland America stopped requisitioning new ships during the 2008 economic downturn but added three new 3,600 passenger ships beginning with Royal Princess in 2013 and Regal Princess which entered service in 2014. A third Fincantieri-built ship, Majestic Princess launched in 2017.</p>
<p>The entire current fleet flies the flag of Bermuda except for Royal, Majestic, Golden, Diamond, and Sapphire Princess which ships call the UK home. Three additional Bermuda-flagged Royal Class vessels are slated for launch in 2019, 2020, and 2022.</p>
<p>Departure points for Princess Cruises include <a href="british-columbia/vancouver.html">Vancouver, Canada</a>, Brisbane, Rozelle, and Melbourne in Australia; Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in the US, as well as <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Rome, Italy, and Piraeus in Greece.</p>
<p>USA Today has awarded Princess the accolade of "Best cruise lines for Gamblers" and slots fans are frequently offered high return tournaments like the $200,000 Monopoly Cruise for Cash tournament. There are tournaments on every cruise so blackjack players and slots spinners have a chance to compete against their shipmates for cash prizes.</p>
<p>Games vary from ship to ship but most voyagers will find traditional, video, and progressive jackpot slot machines as well as video poker. Table games can include heads-up Texas Hold ‘Em poker, and casino games like Caribbean Stud Poker, Three Card Poker and Let it Ride. Blackjack, dice, roulette, and other table games are available on most ships and you can even play bingo with ticket packages ranging from $10 to $30.</p>

<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>

The company is headquartered in <a href="monaco.html">Monaco</a> and owned in the majority (67%) by <a href="owners/royal-caribbean-cruises.html">Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd</a>.</p>
<p>The company's current fleet comprises nine vessels. The largest and newest ship is Silver Muse at 40,700 gross tons and capacity for nearly 600 passengers. Six of the ships are over sixteen tons and three are clippers in the company's Expedition fleet.</p>

<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>

<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>

<p>If you've ever been on a gambling ship, as opposed to a luxury cruise liner with a casino...</p>
<p><strong>You might ask:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I thought gambling was a monopoly in Florida. How do they do it?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, most of the <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots">slots</a> and table games are in the <a href="florida.html">Seminole Tribe's Hard Rock casinos</a>. You can find poker and a few <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">other games like poker</a> at <a href="florida.html">Florida racetracks</a> and jai alai frontons.</p>
<p>Once the ship enters international waters, Florida gambling laws no longer apply.</p>
<p>The 3-mile journey usually takes about 30 minutes - then the games are on!</p>
<h2>#1 Florida Casino Cruise?</h2>
<p>Judging by the reviews on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34117-d2229441-Reviews-Victory_Casino_Cruises-Cape_Canaveral_Brevard_County_Florida.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor</a>, most people are extremely satisfied with their Victory Casino Cruise experiences. Those who weren't might not have known what to expect.</p>
<p>This is a gambling ship <br />You'll be out to sea for 5-6 hours <br />People smoke outside, so you might smell it</p>
<p><strong>You might say:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Okay, I get it. But what about the casino... is it a real casino?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>
<p>It's a real casino alright. There are over 600 slots so there should always be some open. On a busy cruise, they'll open up to 100 gaming tables. That puts it on par with most Downtown Las Vegas properties and quite a few on the Strip.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you can play...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slots</li>
<li>Blackjack $5-$500 - dealer stands all 17's - BJ pays 3:2</li>
<li>Craps</li>
<li>Roulette</li>

<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>Visit Windstar Cruises to find a cruise, plan your journey, look for specials, or<a href="https://www.windstarcruises.com/yachts/" target="_blank"> dream about the yachts</a>!</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_540" style="display:none"><p>Seafaring gamblers in the Nordic region, especially the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, have been enjoying the gambling services of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paf</a> on Tallink and Silja line cruises for over three decades. The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>
<p>Costa Cruises brand currently operates six casino ships and 8 vessels without gaming facilities. All sail under the Italian flag in the waters of the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, and South America. None of the casino spaces are huge by international standards but all are well appointed and offer tables and slots. The <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-mediterranea-2160.html">Mediterranea</a>, sailing out of Savona in Italy, offers the most slots with over 140 machines, while the <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-atlantica-2156.html">Atlantica</a>, departing from Tianjin, China offers the most table games with a count of 21.</p>
<p>The table game selection varies by ship but you will usually find blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as craps on some vessels.</p>
<p>All of the vessels offer fine dining, recreation, entertainment, shopping, sport, and wellness facilities including spas. Some of the ships without casino feature 4D Cinema as part of the kids' package of family fun.</p>
<p>Some of the amenities found on Costa Cruises Fortuna, sailing out of Port Rashid, Dubai, United Arab Emirates include a theater, library, art gallery, cognac bar and a cigar bar.

<p>You might be asking yourself:</p>
<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Seabourn is a luxury cruise liner...</strong></p>

<li>Formal nights are optional so you could save on wardrobe costs</li>
<li>Prices are all-inclusive so your drinks are paid for</li>

<p>The company's current fleet comprises nine vessels. The largest and newest ship is Silver Muse at 40,700 gross tons and capacity for nearly 600 passengers. Six of the ships are over sixteen tons and three are clippers in the company's Expedition fleet.</p>

<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>

<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package.

<p>If you've ever been on a gambling ship, as opposed to a luxury cruise liner with a casino...</p>
<p><strong>You might ask:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I thought gambling was a monopoly in Florida. How do they do it?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, most of the <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots">slots</a> and table games are in the <a href="florida.html">Seminole Tribe's Hard Rock casinos</a>. You can find poker and a few <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">other games like poker</a> at <a href="florida.html">Florida racetracks</a> and jai alai frontons.</p>
<p>Once the ship enters international waters, Florida gambling laws no longer apply.</p>
<p>The 3-mile journey usually takes about 30 minutes - then the games are on!</p>

<p>This is a gambling ship <br />You'll be out to sea for 5-6 hours <br />People smoke outside, so you might smell it</p>
<p><strong>You might say:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Okay, I get it. But what about the casino... is it a real casino?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>
<p>It's a real casino alright. There are over 600 slots so there should always be some open. On a busy cruise, they'll open up to 100 gaming tables. That puts it on par with most Downtown Las Vegas properties and quite a few on the Strip.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you can play...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slots</li>
<li>Blackjack $5-$500 - dealer stands all 17's - BJ pays 3:2</li>
<li>Craps</li>
<li>Roulette</li>

The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>
<p>Fortunes Casino partners with MGM, so if you remember to use your player's club card you can earn comps and perks at land-based casinos while you are out at sea! All loyalty tiers can redeem points for free casino play. There are 5 tiers and players in the top 3 tiers receive anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in free play each time they sail. There are now more than 20 perks and benefits associated with Blue Chip Club membership.</p>
<p>Passengers will always find excellent dining and lounge options on Celebrity casino cruises as well as entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the best-outfitted vessels for casino gaming players will find about 275 slot machines. <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-millennium-2151.html">Celebrity Millenium</a> sailing out of Hong Kong, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation offer around 190 machines each, about a dozen mixed Las Vegas-style table games, and 1 electronic Pokermate Texas Hold 'Em table.</p>
<p><a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-reflection.html">Celebrity Reflection</a> sailing out of Chile and Brazil, Equinox, Eclipse, Silhouette, and  Solstice each have more than a dozen tables with 2 poker tables each and baccarat upon request. All Fortune Casinos offer at least one single-deck blackjack table. Slots start at $0.01, they include reel slots and video bonus games. Video poker machines are included in the slot machines count.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_871" style="display:none"><p>People who take the seas to gamble in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe know the Costa Cruises experience, or as the line is called in its native Italy, Costa Crociere. Vessels with onboard casinos include those sailing out of <a href="singapore/marina-bay.html">Marina Bay, Singapore</a>; Tianjin, China; Dubai, UAE; Port Louis, Mauritius; Mumbai, India and <a href="italy/savona.html">Savona, Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Starting out with cargo ships in 1854, the company started commercial activities from about 1924 until the first passenger services were begun in 1947 with regular services to South America. The then family-owned company eventually converted their fleet to cruising and became one of the largest operators in Europe before selling to Carnival in the year 2000. The Carnival family of companies now comprises  Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, Cunard Line, Holland America, Seabourn Cruise Lines, and Windstar Cruises with Costa accounting for about 16% of the parent company's revenue.</p>

All sail under the Italian flag in the waters of the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, and South America. None of the casino spaces are huge by international standards but all are well appointed and offer tables and slots. The <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-mediterranea-2160.html">Mediterranea</a>, sailing out of Savona in Italy, offers the most slots with over 140 machines, while the <a href="casino/costa-cruises-costa-atlantica-2156.html">Atlantica</a>, departing from Tianjin, China offers the most table games with a count of 21.</p>
<p>The table game selection varies by ship but you will usually find blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as craps on some vessels.</p>
<p>All of the vessels offer fine dining, recreation, entertainment, shopping, sport, and wellness facilities including spas. Some of the ships without casino feature 4D Cinema as part of the kids' package of family fun.</p>
<p>Some of the amenities found on Costa Cruises Fortuna, sailing out of Port Rashid, Dubai, United Arab Emirates include a theater, library, art gallery, cognac bar and a cigar bar.

<p>You might be wondering:</p>
<p><strong>"How many of the oceangoing vessels have casinos?"</strong></p>
<p>Good news for seafaring gamblers! Royal Caribbean has outfitted their entire current fleet with onboard casinos! Some are a little bigger than others, and some have more game variety, but they all have lots of slots and plenty of table game action.</p>
<p>Sailing out of England? Consider booking the <a href="casino/royal-caribbean-international-navigator-of-the-seas-2222.html">Navigator of the Seas</a>;</p>
<p>From Barcelona, Vision;</p>
<p>Shanghai? <a href="casino/royal-caribbean-quantum-of-the-seas.html">Quantum of the Seas</a>;</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Voyager.</p>
<p>Most of the other cruises depart from the <a href="united-states.html">U.S</a>. and <a href="puerto-rico.html">Puerto Rico</a>.</p>
<p>All of the casinos offer <strong>thousands of square feet of Vegas-style action</strong> under the lights with video slots, video poker, table games, and tournaments.</p>
<p>Some of the table games you can expect to find on your Royal Caribbean cruise are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/1-deck/" target="_blank">Single Deck Blackjack</a></li>
<li>Roulette</li>
<li>Baccarat</li>

<li>Blackjack with Side Bets like Lucky Ladies</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Walking up to a high stakes blackjack table and sitting down with a stack of chips in front of you can seem intimidating to casual players and those who may need to brush up a little on their game. Royal Caribbean has you covered! During the day, your hosts will be glad to teach you the ins and outs of any game from roulette to baccarat. Once you get your "sea legs" for the game you can join a tournament where everyone has a chance to progress to the grand finale without risking stacks of your hard earned cash along the way.</p>
<p>If you want to win big prizes with more help from Lady Luck than your own gambling experience, try a Slot Tournament. Simply go to the Casino Cash Desk when the casino is open to enroll in a qualifying tournament. Even <strong>Beginner's Luck</strong> can help you grab a chunk of the $50,000 prize pool!</p>
<p><strong>This might seem crazy:</strong></p>
<p>Poker players can qualify for the Royal Poker Tournament throughout the year. Winners are eligible for entry into the finals with a chance to win part of the <strong>$100,000 Royal Poker Prize Pool!</strong> Don't forget, you may be eligible for a free cruise vacation for two along the way.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself:</p>
<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Seabourn is a luxury cruise liner...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect to pay top price for your cruise</li>
<li>Formal nights are optional so you could save on wardrobe costs</li>
<li>Prices are all-inclusive so your drinks are paid for</li>
<li>Gourmands will especially appreciate Restaurant 2</li>
</ul>

The company is headquartered in <a href="monaco.html">Monaco</a> and owned in the majority (67%) by <a href="owners/royal-caribbean-cruises.html">Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd</a>.</p>
<p>The company's current fleet comprises nine vessels. The largest and newest ship is Silver Muse at 40,700 gross tons and capacity for nearly 600 passengers. Six of the ships are over sixteen tons and three are clippers in the company's Expedition fleet.</p>
<p>Seafaring gamblers will find casinos aboard:</p>

<p>There are no gaming facilities on the smaller expedition class ships.</p>
<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>
<p>You can click the following link to view the <a href="https://www.silversea.com/ships/silver-shadow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">casino aboard Silver Shadow</a>.</p>
<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package. If unsure of local laws, please wait until you are 12 miles out to sea before you <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/">gambling online</a>.</p>

<p>If you've ever been on a gambling ship, as opposed to a luxury cruise liner with a casino...</p>
<p><strong>You might ask:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I thought gambling was a monopoly in Florida. How do they do it?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, most of the <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots">slots</a> and table games are in the <a href="florida.html">Seminole Tribe's Hard Rock casinos</a>. You can find poker and a few <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">other games like poker</a> at <a href="florida.html">Florida racetracks</a> and jai alai frontons.</p>
<p>Once the ship enters international waters, Florida gambling laws no longer apply.</p>
<p>The 3-mile journey usually takes about 30 minutes - then the games are on!</p>

<p>This is a gambling ship <br />You'll be out to sea for 5-6 hours <br />People smoke outside, so you might smell it</p>
<p><strong>You might say:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Okay, I get it. But what about the casino... is it a real casino?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh yeah!</strong></p>
<p>It's a real casino alright. There are over 600 slots so there should always be some open. On a busy cruise, they'll open up to 100 gaming tables. That puts it on par with most Downtown Las Vegas properties and quite a few on the Strip.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you can play...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slots</li>
<li>Blackjack $5-$500 - dealer stands all 17's - BJ pays 3:2</li>

The &Aring;land-based service provider's contract is up for renewal at five year periods with 2023 on the horizon fore or aft.</p>
<p>Onboard games include popular slots, bingo, poker, table and card games, lotteries, and sports betting. Departure points for gambling cruises include Stockholm in Sweden along with Helsinki and Turku in Finland.</p>
<p>The <a href="casino/baltic-princess-cruise-ship.html">Baltic Princess</a> sails out of Stockholm twice each day and offers full family entertainment and escape with a well-staffed Siljaland playroom for the kids. It's one of the newest ships on the Baltic and offers no-limit Texas Hold'em tournaments and daily live entertainment.</p>
<p>Cruise ferry <a href="casino/silja-galaxy-cruise-ship.html">Galaxy</a> offers 927 cabins over 12 decks, several restaurants and bars, as well as a kids zone. The onboard casino has slots, roulette, and blackjack tables. This vessel is often used for business meetings as the modern 450 conference center attracts the business class as well as weddings and family parties and gatherings. The sauna department is highly rated.</p>
<p>The Silja Symphony departs from Stockholm and is an older ship launched in 1991. A favorite of many seeking a break, this is a unique vessel. The heart of the ship features a pedestrian streetwalk down the Promenade with top-tier restaurants, cafes, and a variety of shops on either side. The casino is located in the bow of the ship on Deck 7 where you'll find roulette, poker and slot machines.</p>
<p>Silja Serenade Cruise Ship sails out of Helsinki and is perhaps the premier gambling ship in the fleet. There are ten classes of cabins and suites from the special cabins designed to accommodate people with special needs and those who are traveling with a pet or have allergies to the Executive Suite on Deck 11 with 75m2 of luxurious space and featuring its own sauna.</p>
<p>Paf has recently upgraded the manual payment system in its casinos on the Tallink &amp; Silja Line, replacing coins with tickets - adding another level of convenience and comfort for adventurers.</p>
<p>AS Tallink Grupp services nearly 10 million passengers each year on its 14 consumer vessels.</p>
<p>Paf also operates the casino aboard <a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">Casino Sunborn in Gibraltar</a>, a 5-star superyacht, and the Paf Casino on &Aring;land with more than 1,500 slot machines and 55 gaming tables in operation.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_885" style="display:none"><p>Big M Gaming LLC operates two gambling cruise ships out of Little River, SC in the United States; <a href="casino/big-m-casino-2122.html">Big "M" Casino Ship I</a> and <a href="casino/big-m-casino-cruise-ii-little-river.html">Big "M" Casino Ship II</a>. The seaside of Little River is better known as Myrtle Beach. It is situated next to the South/North Carolina border and has been continuously inhabited since the first trading post was established in the 1700's.</p>
<p>Big M offers 5-hour gambling cruises with a set-price all you can eat buffet and is very popular in the region. There are no land casinos in the state. The closest terrestrial casino is <a href="casino/harrah-s-cherokee-casino-and-hotel-2924.html">Harrah's Cherokee</a> nearly 6 hours away in North Carolina. Due to strict gambling laws in the state, the only way to play blackjack or slots legally is to go out to sea. Gaming is only allowed after you are at least 3 miles away from shore but the ships may travel as far as 15 miles out. It takes about 45 minutes to reach international waters.</p>
<p>The minimum age to board either ship is 21. Smoking is only allowed on the main deck casino during gaming hours. Both ships also offer smoke-free gaming decks with slot machines. Both ships offer Las Vegas-style gambling. Only Ship I has Texas Hold ’em poker. Both casinos host slots, roulette, craps, Let it Ride, 3-card poker and other specialty games.</p>
<p>Both ships are well maintained and kept clean, although we wouldn't go so far as to refer to them as '<a href="casino/casino-sunborn.html">luxury yachts</a>' as the company does, they are nicely appointed and there is plenty of room to move around. The ships are rarely, if ever, out to sea at the same time so if you have a preference (outer deck smoking, prime rib or seafood buffets, etc.), it's always a good idea to call ahead or visit the website for a schedule and current prices.</p>
<p>The water can get a bit rough any time of the year and the outings occur every month. Some people will choose to eat on the way out, others on the way back to port, and others may not eat at all. The price of the buffet is not included in boarding fees.</p>
<p>The buffet deck is not handicap accessible but staff will gladly bring food to the main deck and set up a comfortable dining space for those who can't reach the restaurant. Sandwiches are available on the top deck throughout the cruise. BUffet prices are reasonable. Beer, wine, and well drinks are about the same price as you'll find in the town of <a href="south-carolina/little-river.html">Little River</a>.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_866" style="display:none"><p>Carnival Cruise Line offers casino gaming on over two dozen ships departing from the U.S. and other ports from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Miami, to <a href="owners/carnival-cruise-line.html">Barcelona, Spain</a>.  While the gaming centers may have different names from vessel to vessel, most are fairly generic capitalizing on formulas the cruise giant has developed over the years. Your Sail &amp; Sign card also doubles as Carnival Players Club card at all of the casinos. <span>The Ocean Players Club covers you on any Carnival Casino cruise, Ibero Cruceros, P&amp;O Cruises, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises.</span></p>
<p>Carnival ships are family ships, so there's always a safe and healthy place for the kids to play while mom and dad head out for a little Las Vegas-style action during their escape to sea. Most Carnival casinos allow passengers 18 years of age and older to enter and play in the casinos.</p>
<p>Common among most of the gaming decks are optional casino tournaments featuring slots, poker, and  <a href="articles/how-to-play-blackjack.html">blackjack</a>. The cost of tournaments change from time to time, ship to ship, and game to game but the payouts for winning on sheer luck can pay for the trip and more.</p>
<p>Slots are the biggest draw with games from top developers and providers such as Aruze, Bally, and IGT. The Sphinx 3D™ by <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/igt">IGT</a> gives players all the thrills they would ever expect in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. But if you want a dealer or croupier to get to know you by name you'll have to go to the table.</p>
<p>Most of the blackjack tables have low buy-ins but if enough high rollers want a game your Carnival casino host will probably accommodate the request. You're not likely to find single-deck action but there are plenty of variations on the basic theme to keep most players happy including Face-Up 21, Fun 21, and classic blackjack.</p>
<p>Most ships offer poker tournaments or at least a table or two for poker players. The electronic PokerPro tables might take some players a couple of minutes to get used to - just cup your hands around the display of face-down cards to see them revealed. If you're a poker junky and on a vessel with  Ocean Medallion technology, you can play 24/7 on your mobile device even if the tables floor tables are closed. <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/newest-slots" target="_blank">Slots</a>, bingo, and roulette are also available on some cruises.</p>
<p>Players won't find free drinks coming around every few minutes like they do in Las Vegas, and you'll have to be at least 21 to order a partake, but Carnival offers double the comps for gameplay compared to other cruise lines. This means that your casino points add up to free beer, wine, and cocktails or even non-alcoholic drinks if you prefer.</p>
<p>For the not-so-serious gamblers, there are also prize games - some require skill, and all require luck. Win a stack of greenbacks on the Cash Cube or try your hand at picking up pricey electronics and other prizes on a claw machine.</p></div><div class="CruiseShipInfo clearfix" id="CruiseShipInfo_873" style="display:none"><p>Celebrity Cruises offer a single brand of casino experience across the fleet of gaming equipped vessels. Every Celebrity cruise ship except the Expedition has a Fortune Casino onboard. All ships offer blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, and a wide range of slot machines.  For guests on the <a href="casino/celebrity-cruises-solstice.html">Celebrity Solstice</a> sailing out of Sydney, and several other cruises, baccarat (punto banco) is also available upon request.</p>
<p>Since the casinos don't open for play until the cruise is in international waters, most gambling laws do not apply. Guests only need to be 18 years old to play, except for the Alaska Cruise which requires guests to be 21 or older.  No matter where the ship is, you need to be 21 to drink. Smoking is not allowed in any Fortunes Casino but all ships have designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
<p>Celebrity Cruises belongs to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) and adheres to council guidelines on gambling entertainment. All facilities and equipment meet regulatory standards equal to Nevada or other licensed jurisdictions for payback percentages ad internal software; abide by rules of play equal to Nevada, New Jersey or England, and all gambling operations are audited by Celebrity's internal audit department on a regular basis, among other controls.</p>

<p>One motto you will hear from Pullmantur Cruises is that <strong>"The Journey is the Destination."</strong> This is enough to tell us that life onboard is about more than excitement and entertainment, you'll also find public spaces such as an atrium on a larger ship, conference rooms and internet centers, and much more.</p>

<p>Dining <br />Entertainment <br />Shopping <br />Health and Fitness</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the casinos are not open 24 hours a day and gaming will not be available unless you are in international waters. Plan on about 45 minutes after leaving port before you can play and the crew will give you plenty of notice when the tables will be closing as you approach the shore.</p>

<p>You might be wondering:</p>
<p><strong>"How many of the oceangoing vessels have casinos?"</strong></p>
<p>Good news for seafaring gamblers! Royal Caribbean has outfitted their entire current fleet with onboard casinos! Some are a little bigger than others, and some have more game variety, but they all have lots of slots and plenty of table game action.</p>

<p>Most of the other cruises depart from the <a href="united-states.html">U.S</a>. and <a href="puerto-rico.html">Puerto Rico</a>.</p>
<p>All of the casinos offer <strong>thousands of square feet of Vegas-style action</strong> under the lights with video slots, video poker, table games, and tournaments.</p>
<p>Some of the table games you can expect to find on your Royal Caribbean cruise are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/1-deck/" target="_blank">Single Deck Blackjack</a></li>
<li>Roulette</li>

Royal Caribbean has you covered! During the day, your hosts will be glad to teach you the ins and outs of any game from roulette to baccarat. Once you get your "sea legs" for the game you can join a tournament where everyone has a chance to progress to the grand finale without risking stacks of your hard earned cash along the way.</p>
<p>If you want to win big prizes with more help from Lady Luck than your own gambling experience, try a Slot Tournament.

<p><strong>This might seem crazy:</strong></p>
<p>Poker players can qualify for the Royal Poker Tournament throughout the year. Winners are eligible for entry into the finals with a chance to win part of the <strong>$100,000 Royal Poker Prize Pool!</strong> Don't forget, you may be eligible for a free cruise vacation for two along the way.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself:</p>
<p>Should I book a Seabourn Cruise for gambling?</p>
<p>The answer to that is simple. It depends on what you are looking for in a casino cruise...</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> How long do I want to be on the ship? <br /><strong>2)</strong> How much time will I spend in the casino? <br /><strong>3)</strong> Do I want a Las Vegas on the seas experience? <br /><strong>4)</strong> Would I be happy with a few slot machines and occasional table action? <br /><strong>5)</strong> Can I afford a Seabourn casino cruise?</p>
<p>We'll help you answer those questions and more by sharing some things we know about the <strong>Seabourn Difference</strong>.</p>
<p>Seabourn offers Caribbean cruises as short as seven days. They also offer mid-length ventures and journeys up to 100 days. Shore excursions are available on some cruises.</p>
<p>The casinos onboard the ships are all on Deck 5 near the aft deck. They are small by most land casino standards with less than two dozen slots and video poker machines and 3 or 4 gaming tables. The gaming areas are located fore of The Club and near the Club Bar. Men and women's restrooms are adjacent to the gaming areas.</p>
<p>The gaming areas are well appointed and well kept. They simply aren't large enough to provide a Las Vegas-style experience when you aren't actually gambling. Table games include <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack</a>, <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/roulette">Roulette</a>, and <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/poker-games">Poker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Seabourn is a luxury cruise liner...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect to pay top price for your cruise</li>
<li>Formal nights are optional so you could save on wardrobe costs</li>
<li>Prices are all-inclusive so your drinks are paid for</li>

<p>You might be wondering...</p>
<p>What are the best cruises for gambling?</p>
<p>Really, any cruise anywhere in the world under 7 days is best. Why?</p>
<p>The longer cruises tend to attract older vacationers who go to bed early. If you like the casino all to yourself, a longer cruise may be best.</p>
<p>All of the ships with gaming offer Blackjack, Roulette, and slots. The two newer and larger ships have roomier, more opulent casino gaming areas with plenty of action. The smallest casino is on Silversea Wind with nine gaming machines and four tables.</p>

<p><strong>True luxury at mid-class prices:</strong></p>
<p>All inclusive pricing makes a Silverseas cruise an easy decision. You'll find most of your cruise mates are couples and the younger more upwardly mobile families have opted for a Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
<p>Enjoy: <br /><br />All-Inclusive experience (gratuities included in fare) <br />Fine dining (diverse cuisine, open seating, 24 hours) <br />Private veranda (855 of suites) <br />Very personalized service (Butler service in every suite) <br />Champagne, wine, and spirits (anywhere on the ship including in-suite) <br />Entertainment <br />Complimentary transportation (in most port towns) <br />Spa and fitness facilities</p>
<h2>If I run out of cash can I get an advance for the casino or shore excursions?</h2>
<p>Cash advances are limited to $1,000 per voyage per suite. Onboard cash advance services incur a 2% fee. Onboard credit cannot be used in the casino.</p>
<h2>Can I gamble online?</h2>
<p>Silversea offers unlimited free Wi-Fi. There are no known restrictions on personal usage. Your suite status will determine a premium or standard Wi-Fi package. If unsure of local laws, please wait until you are 12 miles out to sea before you <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/">gambling online</a>.</p>

As its online market progresses at a slow crawl, the country&rsquo;s regulatory system, the Regulatory Authority for Online Games (ARJEL), which stems from the Gambling Act, ultimately controls the state of online gambling in France.

Yet, it has adopted and operates under the same banking, insurance, and investment laws as Guernsey.

                  My friend believes that many of the Vegas casinos pump oxygen through the air conditioning system to enrich the air. The purpose is to keep you from sleeping as long and therefore gambling more. I didn't notice any difference in my sleeping habits, but still, my friend insists he's right. Is he?                  </a>

                  <p>Colin, your friend is full of, of, of, OK, I'll be nice, baloney. What comes to mind every time I hear this rumor are the three Apollo astronauts <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0127.html" target="_blank">who died when a small spark combined with oxygen</a> ignited their space capsule creating one of NASA's worst disasters.<br />
<br />
According to my neighbor, Dick (Captain, South San Francisco Fire Department), "<em>pumping oxygen into a casino would be a tremendous fire hazard that would greatly increase the flammability of all other objects. Any small fire, anywhere in the hotel, would be fanned and magnify itself by pumped oxygen.</em>" As for the risk/reward opportunity, <b>no casino would ever entertain the thought</b>.<br />
<br />
Of course, that doesn't mean the casino doesn't have its share of tricks to part bettors from their cash. Casinos spend tens of thousands of dollars each year studying whether scents, interior design (yes, even that gaudy carpeting) or trying to keep the light off the foreheads of customers-which is draining on them from an energy standpoint-will make players stay and play more. If somehow a casino could figure out how to keep each and every patron playing just five more minutes a night, it would add millions to a casino's gross each year.<br />
<br />
Now back to this ridiculous rumor of pumping oxygen, Colin. It does have a starting point. I believe ground zero comes from Mario Puzo's book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22035.Fools_Die" target="_blank">Fools Die</a>, where the practice of pumping oxygen was written by Puzo regarding the mythical Las Vegas casino Xanadu. I guess your friend translated this fictional work into reality, but hey, Colin, maybe casinos one day will try decreasing the oxygen to disorient the players even more than they already are. </p>

                  I'm about to make my first trip to Las Vegas. Can you give me your favorite King Midas tip that will turn my trip into gold? <br />

                  <p>Why King Midas, Jerome? When I think of King Midas my thoughts turn toward greed. In <a href="http://www.ancient-literature.com/rome_ovid.html" target="_blank">Ovid's</a> Greek tale, Midas was so greedy he wanted everything he touched to turn to gold. To his delight, his wish came true, and he proceeded to gild everything in sight. But like a rapacious player who wants to win every hand, his fate was tragic in the end. He killed his own beloved daughter with his magical touch.<br />
<br />
But you probably don't give a hoot about some Roman poet's tale and only want a hot tip for success, so here's my favorite: <b>Only make bets that have less than a two percent house advantage</b>.<br />
<br />
You didn't mention what type of casino games you prefer, Jerome, so I'll trumpet my favored plays below. <b>All represent wagers that have a house edge of less than two percent.</b><br />
<br />
<a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">Blackjack:</a> With perfect basic strategy.<br />
<a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/video-poker">Video Poker:</a> Again, using perfect basic strategy.<br />
<a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/craps">Craps:</a> A pass line wager, odds on that pass-line bet and placing the six or eight.<br />
<a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/baccarat">Baccarat:</a> The bank or player hand.<br />
<a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/slots">Slots:</a> Yes, even a cybernetic one-armed bandit can be a good play if it's advertised as a 98 plus percent return machine.<br />

                  <p>Quite the contrary, Randall. The second you get on a hot streak, casinos prefer pit employees to "<i>change color</i>" or upgrade your chips. <b>No</b>, they're not being courteous, just trying to <b>induce larger play</b>. Because most players don't equate casino chips with real money, it's easy to get caught up in the game and forget what you're actually betting. <i>Treat all chips, won or lost, like Friday's paycheck-your hard-earned money</i>. </p>

                  By showing my driver’s license at our local casino, I get a casino "<i>fun</i>" book. One of the coupons in it is a Match Play coupon for $10. What would you recommend as a bet when using it?                  </a>
               </h4>
            </div>
            <div id="collapse5" style="" class="panel-collapse collapse" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer" itemprop="acceptedAnswer">
               <div class="panel-body" itemprop="text">
                  <p>Match Play coupons are often found in casino fun books and can often be had by going up to the casino cage and just asking for one. When a player uses a match play coupon with a real "<i>even money</i>" bet, then the match play will be converted to a like amount in cash if the player wins. For example, if the player has a $10 match play coupon and pairs it with a $10 wager in blackjack, and if the player wins, his $10 will win $10 and his match play will be converted to ten real bucks. Win or lose, the match play coupon is then taken out of play. In the event of a push, as often happens in blackjack, the match play coupon stays in play until the bet is resolved. If the player happens to get a blackjack, the coupon is converted to its face value, in your case $10, and not $15.<br />
<br />
The competition to accompany the <b>match play coupon with your hard-earned cash should be limited to wagers that have less than a two percent house edge</b>. My favorite would be one hand of <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/blackjack">blackjack</a>, but you wouldn't go wrong with a bank or player hand in <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/baccarat">baccarat</a>, or a pass line bet or placing the six or eight in <a href="https://online.worldcasinodirectory.com/craps">craps</a>.<br />
<br />
Each of these bets has less than a 1.5% casino advantage, which makes the true value of a match play coupon slightly less than half of its face value since the probability of winning any of them is also less than half.</p>

                  <p>Quite the contrary, Danny. <b>It's a huge advantage for the casino, and here's why</b>. Casinos win for two reasons. First, a statistical edge (percentage advantage) on each and every game, and second, they have a whole lot more cash and staying power than you do. For the latter, it's a simple concept called "<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GamblersRuin.html" target="_blank">gambler's ruin</a>." In essence, it's how long will it take you with your limited bankroll to lose everything to a casino, which has a relatively infinite wad of cash. So even if you do have a short-term winning streak, Danny, when the house has this infinite stake, they can, and will, always outlast you.<br />
<br />
Now to your situation playing the high minimums/low maximums limits. When you have a casino with a competition-free monopoly, you tend to find table limits that, in my humble opinion, border on larceny. This scenario eliminates low-stakes betting (high minimums); plus, the ability to parlay your winnings by increasing your bets (low maximums) is removed. Unfortunately, when you play under these conditions, depletion of a low roller's bankroll in a matter of minutes is not uncommon.<br />
<br />
So the long and short of it is this, Danny. <b>Avoid playing high minimums/low maximums table limits like the plague!</b></p>

                  <p>By sprinkling salt, this superstitious gambler was trying to make the machine pay off by using salt's association with money.

                  <p><b>PLENTY</b>, Michelle! My goal as a player-advocate columnist is to develop players who can identify beneficial gaming situations, not only the bets you make in a casino but the casinos themselves. <b>So are all casinos the same? No</b>, the correct answer is this: No two casinos are alike. Some are good, and some, well let me describe the differences:<br />
<br />
<b>The Good:</b> Though more come to mind, I'll give you two examples: the <a href="casino/club-cal-neva-hotel-casino-2579.html">Club Cal Neva in Reno</a> and <a href="casino/binions-gambling-hall.html">Binions Gambling Hall in Las Vegas</a>. Here's what they offer their cherished players, that's you and me, Michelle. Besides some of the cheapest food prices 99&#162; breakfasts and $3.99 steak dinner, they offer great gaming plays like 25&#162; crap games with up to 10 times odds, single-deck blackjack with liberal rules, single-zero roulette, excellent video poker pay tables, loads of loose nickel and quarter machines and comps just for breathing.<br />
<br />
These casinos, the ones that treat you like a treasured commodity and are always trying to increase buyer value, are casinos I hope you, Michelle, will migrate to.<br />
<br />
<b>The Bad:</b> Quite possibly, this is the casino you normally play in. Gouging table limits on the weekends; tough getting comps (stale popcorn and lucky dogs don't cut it); poor pay tables on video poker machines; and tight slots. Basically, they put out games for your convenience and count their money. Plus, the practice of my #1 rule of casino management, who's the boss, you the customer, is limited. If your favorite casino has any of the above symptoms, maybe it's time to change.<br />
<br />
<b>The Ugly:</b> <a href="casino/casino-windsor-239.html">Casino Windsor</a>. Knowing full well they have the only game in town, Detroiters who cross the river to Canada-and all players for that matter-are being ripped off, <b>big time!</b> For starters, charging $40 for valet parking and instant admission versus parking two blocks away and waiting up to two hours to get in is absurd. Hopefully, that has changed. But I'm just warming up. They opened with $15 table minimums/$200 maximums-which can deplete a modest bankroll in mere minutes; zero nickel, very limited quarter and mostly dollar slots; and very poor pay tables on video poker machines equaling what you would find in airports and grocery stores. Finally the triple whammy: I found food service at the buffet slow, quality only fair, and prices high. Unequivocally, two thumbs down on Casino Windsor.<br />
<br />
But even I get the worst of it once in a while, Michelle. After spending the day lounging poolside at the <a href="casino/the-mirage-2812.html">Mirage Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas</a>, my friends and I decided instead of watching a sporting event in their sports book-we were just too tired (lazy) to leave the room-that some beer and a few snacks in our room would do the trick. We each threw in a few bucks and sent our runner (scissors cuts paper) down to a convenience store called "<i>Impulse</i>" in the Mirage Hotel. Noting here that all the "<i>buyer impulse</i>" merchandise we purchased wasn't priced, the cost of two six-packs, one small package of Jerky, and two eight-ounce boxes of Cheese Nips: $29.43! Thought I would pass along my lesson learned to you.<br />

So, Michelle, the key here is shopping for value, not only on your bet selection but learning to shop casinos. Warren Nelson, the owner of the Club Cal Neva in Reno, has lived by a simple principle most of his career: "<i>Give the players the best bet (lowest odds for the house) that you can while still making a profit, and they will play longer, leave satisfied and come back bringing their friends.</i>" I applaud his sound reasoning and, Michelle, that's the kind of casino where you should play.</p>

                  <p>You do realize, Gary, that you plunk and the dealer snatches. All six wagers on the Big 6 carry a steep house edge. That casino advantage is as follows: 11.1 percent on the $1 spot, 16.6% on the $2, 22.2% on the $5, 18.5% on the $10, 22.2% on the $20, and 24% on either joker.<br />

                  <p>In the casino business, the best admonition to get ahead is "<i>Never make suggestions.</i>" As for a gambling nugget, the following voice of reason caught my attention while I was walking down the Strip in Las Vegas.<br />
<br />
A panhandler approached and asked if I had any loose change so he could buy a hot dog. Unfortunately, spare change doesn't exist in Las Vegas. Strategically positioned slot machines allow you to travel light. But I guess I'm an easy mark for a hot dog story so I gave him a nickel chip-casino talk for $5-that I had in my coat pocket.<br />
<br />
After his gratitude for my allowing him to bump up into buffet dining, or whatever, he shared some of his best gaming wisdom. "<b>Go downtown to Binion's and make a pass line bet and take those 10 times odds. It's one of the best bets in the house,</b>" he said.<br />
<br />
Guess what, Ned? He's right on. The house advantage on this wager is .018%. Those multiple odds he was talking about- zero casino advantage. It's the line bet where the casino enjoys its slight edge. And I mean slight. Expected mathematical loss on a $1 line bet with $10 odds, about 4¢. But we can combat that too, Ned. Throw in a few free drinks and pry a breakfast out of a floorman, you're getting to the point where they're paying you to play.<br />
<br />
Yes, advice comes from the funniest places.</p>

                  My brother likes to play single deck blackjack games, while I enjoy a casino that offers a decent buffet and a cocktail waitress that comes to the keno lounge more than once an hour. So, we cannot always gamble in the same casino. I probably already know what you will say, but what in your opinion of what makes "<i>the best</i>" casino? I am appealing to your love of the buffet. <br />

                  <p>Granted, Jack, I have my favorite buffet stops across the American casino landscape, but that doesn't necessarily mean a superior feeding-frenzy-forum equals "<i>the best</i>" casino.<br />
<br />
It is no secret that casinos have a <b>mathematical edge over players on all their games</b>. This fact alone makes it tough for players to win. The higher the casino's edge, the lower the chances the player will end up a winner. With the casino enjoying this mathematical advantage over the player, the key to "<i>the best</i>" is to know where to play, which games offer the best chance at winning, and learn how to beat them.<br />
<br />
You should judge a casino "<i>the best</i>" if its gaming rules maximize a player's chance of winning. Consider this Starving Player's Checklist: single versus double zeros on a roulette table; blackjack dealt from a single deck with liberal rules like doubling on anything, re-splitting and surrender; a crap game with five or ten times odds in lieu of two-times odds; 9/6 video poker machines; a mini-baccarat table with low limits; casinos that advertise 98.5% paybacks on their slot machines, and then tell you which machines those are when you ask.<br />
<br />
Besides, Jack, my New Years Resolution (authored by my wife) was to avoid the buffet chow lines, but not a decent-paying video poker machine</p>
